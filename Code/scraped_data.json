Food forms an essential part of the culture of North East India, and is a traveller's urge to understand the unknown, the food of Arunachal Pradesh is a topic that draws a lot of attention! The first thing you should know about Arunachal Pradesh food is that it differs from tribe to tribe.As you move toward the eastern side of Arunachal people are dependent on bamboo and other leafy vegetables which are strictly boiled. Fried food is not very popular as people like to eat either boiled or smoked food. As you move toward the town ofTawangand places closer to the country of Tibet you'll notice that dairy products are more in use. The people closest to the city are more dependent on a normal day to day products.Now coming to the Food of Arunachal Pradesh:1. RiceRice- The Staple Food of Arunachal. (Source)Rice is a staple food in Arunachal Pradesh food, and any other food is just a side dish. The most important and different thing about their rice is that in Arunachal, they prefer to cook their rice in the hollow bamboo over some hot coal to give it a different flavour than other types of rice. Who doesn't want to taste that right?2. Bamboo ShootBamboo shoot (Source)Bamboo shoot is widely eaten through all the North Eastern States because of its delicate flavour and is a chief component of food in Arunachal Pradesh. The delicious bamboo shoots are used in the dishes of boiled vegetables, cooked meat, pickles and chutneys.3. Pika PilaPika pila (Source)Pika pila is a famous type of a pickle that is mostly made by theApatani tribeof Arunachal Pradesh. It is a favourite accompaniment of food in Arunachal Pradesh. Pika Pila is a type of a pickle that is made by using bamboo shoot and pork fat with a little addition of King Chilly. It is hot but not very spicy as to make you feel sick.4. LukterBeef sprinkled with chilly flaked while being smoked dry. (Source)Another delicacy of the Arunachal Pradesh Food is the Lukter. Nothing complicated, Lukter is a combination of cooked dry meat and chilly flakes from the King chilly or Bhut Jolokia. Like the norm goes with Arunachal, this too is just a side dish meant to be eaten with the rice.5. Pehakchutney made with chilli and fermented soya beans. (Source)Pehak is also a side dish delicacy of Arunachal Pradesh Food. Pehak is a type of spicy chutney that is made by the use of fermented soya bean and chilli. The chilly obviously being the King chilly is the main ingredient in this dish as that's what makes it hot and spicy. The taste of flavored rice along with this spicy tangy mash makes for an awesome dish!6. ApongApong- Rice beer. (Source)Well all of you must be wondering what is apong? It is just another name for rice beer and is one of the most important traditional drink of Arunachal, and forms an important part of cuisine in Arunachal Pradesh. This beer is home-made, free of any chemicals and is also light on the buds if you're a light drinker and want a little light beer instead of the usual strong commercialized one.7. MaruaMarua- An alcoholic beverage. (Source)Just like the Apong, Marua is also home-made alcohol that is very famous in Arunachal Pradesh cuisine. The only difference is that this alcoholic beverage is made of millet instead of rice. A common drink that Arunachalis enjoy drinking on occasions.8. Chura SabjiWorth a shot isn't it?Now I personally have not developed a taste for this dish yet but all the people I know absolutely love it. It is a kind of a curry made of fermented cheese made by either yak milk or cow's milk and not to forget most important the flakes and a few pieces of the King chilly which makes it spicy but delicious.9. MoMoMomos. (Source)The defining food of the northeast, stuffed dumplings known as momos are ubiquitous acrossDelhiand the northeast and are usually filled with various vegetables like cabbage, potato, carrot in their vegetarian variants and chicken, mutton, and beef are used in their non-vegetarian counterparts. If you haven't tried it yet please do so soon, they are among the most famous food of Arunachal Pradesh!10. MeatMithun- Main source of meat in Arunachal. (Source)I've saved the best for the last. Meat is the main delicacy of Arunachal Pradesh. Until now, I have not met a single Arunachali who doesn't love meat be it Chicken, Mutton or pork. The people of Arunachal however, prefer not to have their meat fried, and it's either boiled or smoked and the most common meat is that of an animal called 'Mithun' (Bos frontalis), a member of the cattle family found only in the North East.Thanks to my Arunachali friends for providing me with the above.This post was published bySimran RigzinShare this post on social mediaFacebookTwitterArunachal Pradesh Travel PackagesCompare quotes from upto 3 travel agents for free6 Nights / 7 DaysBest Arunachal Pradesh Tour For 7 DaysBhalukpong(1N) →  Dirang(1N) →  Tawang(3N) →  Bomdila(1N)₹25,400/personGet Offers>4 Nights / 5 DaysUltimate Arunachal Pradesh PackageBomdila(1N) → Tawang(2N) →  Bhalukpong(1N)₹ 25,00012% off₹22,000/personGet Offers>5 Nights / 6 DaysExplore Arunachal Pradesh Tour PackageBhalukpong(1N) → Dirang(1N) → Tawang(2N) → Bomdila(1N)₹24,200/personGet Offers>5 Nights / 6 DaysAmazing Arunachal and Assam for 6 DaysTawang(2N) → Bomdila(2N) → Guwahati(1N)₹12,000/personGet Offers>5 Nights / 6 DaysZiro Valley Tour Package - 5 Nights 6 DaysItanagar(1N) →  Ziro(3N) →  Itanagar(1N)₹ 25,45013% off₹22,000/personGet Offers>7 Nights / 8 DaysGroup Tour to Arunachal PradeshDirang(1N) → Tawang(2N) → Bomdila(1N) →  Ziro(2N) → Itana...₹29,999/personGet Offers>View All Packages For Arunachal PradeshView All Packages For Arunachal PradeshRelated ArticlesArt & CultureArunachal Pradesh Culture : Traditions, Craft and Food of Arunachal PradeshArt & CultureTraditional Tribal Dresses of Arunachal PradeshTransportAirports In Arunachal PradeshTravelogueArunachal: Paradise on Earth #TWCNewsNow You Can Take A Train to Tawang in Arunachal - Read More to Find OutExperiencesThis Homestay in Dirang is the Perfect Place to Relax Amidst Nature!Inner Line Permit (ILP) for Arunachal Pradesh: A Comprehensive GuideWildlife & NatureNational Parks in Arunachal Pradesh & Wildlife SanctuariesExperiencesThings to Do in Arunachal PradeshHeritage & ArchitectureTop Historical Places in Arunachal PradeshHill StationsHill Stations in Arunachal PradeshAdventureTrekking in Arunachal Pradesh For A Weekend EscapeSightseeingTop Places near rivers & lakes in Arunachal PradeshComments on this postBrowse Package CollectionsArunachal Pradesh Package CollectionsArunachal Pradesh Honeymoon PackagesTop Places in Arunachal PradeshTawangZiroBhalukpongRoingItanagarAnini Food of Arunachal Pradesh | A Guide to The Delicious Cuisine of Arunachal!₹ 8,000onwardsView PackagesGet Package OffersArunachal Pradeshis one of the states of northeasternIndiaand just like all the other North-Eastern states, its tradition and culture are one of the main focus of Indian tourism.

Meat is the main delicacy of Arunachal Pradesh. Until now, I have not met a single Arunachali who doesn't love meat be it Chicken, Mutton or pork. The people of Arunachal however, prefer not to have their meat fried, and it's either boiled or smoked and the most common meat is that of an animal called 'Mithun' (Bos frontalis), a member of the cattle family found only in the North East.Thanks to my Arunachali friends for providing me with the above. Arunachal Pradeshis one of the states of northeasternIndiaand just like all the other North-Eastern states, its tradition and culture are one of the main focus of Indian tourism. Food forms an essential part of the culture of North East India, and is a traveller's urge to understand the unknown, the food of Arunachal Pradesh is a topic that draws a lot of attention! The first thing you should know about Arunachal Pradesh food is that it differs from tribe to tribe.As you move toward the eastern side of Arunachal people are dependent on bamboo and other leafy vegetables which are strictly boiled. Fried food is not very popular as people like to eat either boiled or smoked food. As you move toward the town ofTawangand places closer to the country of Tibet you'll notice that dairy products are more in use. The people closest to the city are more dependent on a normal day to day products.Now coming to the Food of Arunachal Pradesh:1. RiceRice- The Staple Food of Arunachal. (Source)Rice is a staple food in Arunachal Pradesh food, and any other food is just a side dish. The most important and different thing about their rice is that in Arunachal, they prefer to cook their rice in the hollow bamboo over some hot coal to give it a different flavour than other types of rice. Who doesn't want to taste that right?2. Bamboo ShootBamboo shoot (Source)Bamboo shoot is widely eaten through all the North Eastern States because of its delicate flavour and is a chief component of food in Arunachal Pradesh. The delicious bamboo shoots are used in the dishes of boiled vegetables, cooked meat, pickles and chutneys.3. Pika PilaPika pila (Source)Pika pila is a famous type of a pickle that is mostly made by theApatani tribeof Arunachal Pradesh. It is a favourite accompaniment of food in Arunachal Pradesh. Pika Pila is a type of a pickle that is made by using bamboo shoot and pork fat with a little addition of King Chilly. It is hot but not very spicy as to make you feel sick.4. LukterBeef sprinkled with chilly flaked while being smoked dry. (Source)Another delicacy of the Arunachal Pradesh Food is the Lukter. Nothing complicated, Lukter is a combination of cooked dry meat and chilly flakes from the King chilly or Bhut Jolokia. Like the norm goes with Arunachal, this too is just a side dish meant to be eaten with the rice.5. Pehakchutney made with chilli and fermented soya beans. (Source)Pehak is also a side dish delicacy of Arunachal Pradesh Food. Pehak is a type of spicy chutney that is made by the use of fermented soya bean and chilli. The chilly obviously being the King chilly is the main ingredient in this dish as that's what makes it hot and spicy. The taste of flavored rice along with this spicy tangy mash makes for an awesome dish!6. ApongApong- Rice beer. (Source)Well all of you must be wondering what is apong? It is just another name for rice beer and is one of the most important traditional drink of Arunachal, and forms an important part of cuisine in Arunachal Pradesh. This beer is home-made, free of any chemicals and is also light on the buds if you're a light drinker and want a little light beer instead of the usual strong commercialized one.7. MaruaMarua- An alcoholic beverage. (Source)Just like the Apong, Marua is also home-made alcohol that is very famous in Arunachal Pradesh cuisine. The only difference is that this alcoholic beverage is made of millet instead of rice. A common drink that Arunachalis enjoy drinking on occasions.8. Chura SabjiWorth a shot isn't it?Now I personally have not developed a taste for this dish yet but all the people I know absolutely love it. It is a kind of a curry made of fermented cheese made by either yak milk or cow's milk and not to forget most important the flakes and a few pieces of the King chilly which makes it spicy but delicious.9.

    "text": "\n Hyderabad[a] is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Telangana. It occupies 650 km2 (250 sq mi) on the Deccan Plateau along the banks of the Musi River, in the northern part of Southern India. With an average altitude of 536 m (1,759 ft), much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain around artificial lakes, including the Hussain Sagar lake, predating the city's founding, in the north of the city centre. According to the 2011 census of India, Hyderabad is the fourth-most populous city in India with a population of 6.9 million residents within the city limits, and has a population of 9.7 million residents in the metropolitan region, making it the sixth-most populous metropolitan area in India.\n The Qutb Shahi dynasty's Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah established Hyderabad in 1591 to extend the capital beyond the fortified Golconda. In 1687, the city was annexed by the Mughals. In 1724, Asaf Jah I, the Mughal viceroy, declared his sovereignty and founded the Asaf Jahi dynasty, also known as the Nizams. Hyderabad served as the imperial capital of the Asaf Jahis from 1769 to 1948. As the capital of the princely state of Hyderabad, the city housed the British Residency and cantonment until Indian independence in 1947. Hyderabad was annexed by the Indian Union in 1948 and continued as a capital of Hyderabad State from 1948 to 1956. After the introduction of the States Reorganisation Act of 1956, Hyderabad was made the capital of the newly formed Andhra Pradesh. In 2014, Andhra Pradesh was split to form the state of Telangana, and Hyderabad became the joint capital of the two states until 2024.[5] Since 1956, the city has housed the Rashtrapati Nilayam, the winter office of the president of India.\n Relics of the Qutb Shahi and Nizam eras remain visible today; the Charminar has come to symbolise the city. By the end of the early modern era, the Mughal Empire had declined in the Deccan, and the Nizam's patronage attracted men of letters from various parts of the world. A distinctive culture arose from the amalgamation of local and migrated artisans, with painting, handicraft, jewellery, literature, dialect and clothing prominent even today. For its cuisine, the city is listed as a creative city of gastronomy by UNESCO. The Telugu film industry based in the city is the highest-grossing film industry in India as of 2021[update].\n Until the 19th century, Hyderabad was known for its pearl industry and was nicknamed the \"City of Pearls\", and was the only trading centre for Golconda diamonds in the world. Many of the city's historical and traditional bazaars remain open. Hyderabad's central location between the Deccan Plateau and the Western Ghats, and industrialisation throughout the 20th century attracted major Indian research, manufacturing, educational and financial institutions. Since the 1990s, the city has emerged as an Indian hub of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology and information technology. The formation of the special economic zones of Hardware Park and HITEC City, dedicated to information technology, has encouraged leading multinationals to set up operations in Hyderabad.\n The name Hyderabad means \"Haydar's City\" or \"Lion City\", from Haydar 'lion' and ābād 'city', after Caliph Ali Ibn Abi Talib, also known as Haydar because of his lion-like valour in battle.[6] The city was originally called Baghnagar (city of gardens).[7][8] The European travellers von Poser and Thévenot found both names in use in the 17th century.[9][10][11]: 6 \n A popular legend suggests that the founder of the city, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, named it Bhagya-nagar (\"fortunate city\")[12] after Bhagmati, a local nautch (dancing girl) whom he married. She converted to Islam and adopted the title Hyder Mahal, the city being subsequently named Hyderabad in her honour.[11]: 6 [13]\n In the year 1597, Hyderabad gained the epithet Farkhunda Bunyad (lit. 'Of Auspicious Foundation'). Following the Mughal conquest of Hyderabad, emperor Aurangzeb changed the epithet to Dar-ul-Jihad (lit. 'Abode of Holy War'), a title which appears on coins minted in the city during the reigns of Aurangzeb and Kam Bakhsh. The later Mughal emperor Shah Alam returned the city to its older epithet of Farkhunda Bunyad, and consequently Mughal coins of Shah Alam and Muhammad Shah feature this title as the city's mint-name.[14][15]\n The discovery of Megalithic burial sites and cairn circles in the suburbs of Hyderabad, in 1851 by Philip Meadows Taylor, a polymath in the service of the Nizam, had provided evidence that the region in which the city stands has been inhabited since the Stone Age.[16][17] In 2008, Archaeologists excavating near the city have unearthed Iron Age sites that may date from 500 BCE.[18] The region comprising modern Hyderabad and its surroundings was ruled by the Chalukya dynasty from 624 CE to 1075 CE.[19] Following the dissolution of the Chalukya empire into four parts in the 11th century, Golconda—now part of Hyderabad—came under the control of the Kakatiya dynasty from 1158, whose seat of power was at Warangal—148 km (92 mi) northeast of modern Hyderabad.[20] The Kakatiya ruler Ganapatideva (1199–1262) built a hilltop outpost—later known as Golconda Fort—to defend their western region.[17]\n The Kakatiya dynasty was reduced to a vassal of the Khalji dynasty in 1310 after its defeat by Sultan Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate. This lasted until 1321 when the Kakatiya dynasty was annexed by Malik Kafur, Khalji's general.[21] During this period, Khalji took the Koh-i-Noor diamond, which is said to have been mined from the Kollur Mines of Golconda, to Delhi.[22] Muhammad bin Tughluq succeeded to the Delhi sultanate in 1325, bringing Warangal under the rule of the Tughlaq dynasty; Malik Maqbul Tilangani was appointed its governor. In 1336 the regional chieftains Musunuri Nayakas—who revolted against the Delhi sultanate in 1333—took Warangal under their direct control and declared it as their capital.[23] In 1347 when Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah, a governor under bin Tughluq, rebelled against Delhi and established the Bahmani Sultanate in the Deccan Plateau, with Gulbarga—200 km (124 mi) west of Hyderabad—as its capital, both the neighbouring rulers Musunuri Nayakas of Warangal and Bahmani Sultans of Gulbarga engaged in many wars until 1364–65 when a peace treaty was signed and the Musunuri Nayakas ceded Golconda Fort to the Bahmani Sultan. The Bahmani Sultans ruled the region until 1518 and were the first independent Muslim rulers of the Deccan.[24][25][26]\n In 1496 Sultan Quli was appointed as a Bahmani governor of Telangana. He rebuilt, expanded and fortified the old mud fort of Golconda and named the city \"Muhammad Nagar\". In 1518, he revolted against the Bahmani Sultanate and established the Qutb Shahi dynasty.[20][27][28] The fifth Qutb Shahi sultan, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, established Hyderabad on the banks of the Musi River in 1591,[29][30] to avoid water shortages experienced at Golconda.[31] During his rule, he had the Charminar and Mecca Masjid built in the city.[32] On 21 September 1687, the Golconda Sultanate came under the rule of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb after a year-long siege of the Golconda Fort.[33][34] The annexed city \"Hyderabad\" was renamed Darul Jihad (House of War),[35] whereas the main territories of the Golconda Sultanate were incorporated into the Mughal empire as the province Hyderabad Subah.[36] Mughal rule in Hyderabad was administered by three main governors: Jan Sipar Khan (1688–1700), his son Rustam Dil Khan (1700–13) and Mubariz Khan (1713–24).[37]\n In 1713, Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar appointed Mubariz Khan as Governor of Hyderabad. During his tenure, he fortified the city and controlled the internal and neighbouring threats.[38] In 1714 Farrukhsiyar appointed Asaf Jah I as Viceroy of the Deccan—(administrator of six Mughal governorates) with the title Nizam-ul-Mulk (Administrator of the Realm). In 1721, he was appointed as Prime Minister of the Mughal Empire.[39] His differences with the court nobles led him to resign from all the imperial responsibilities in 1723 and leave for Deccan.[40][41] Under the influence of Asaf Jah I's opponents, Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah issued a decree to Mubariz Khan, to stop Asaf Jah I which resulted in the Battle of Shakar Kheda.[40]: 93–94  In 1724, Asaf Jah I defeated Mubariz Khan to establish autonomy over the Deccan, named the region Hyderabad Deccan, and started what came to be known as the Asaf Jahi dynasty. Subsequent rulers retained the title Nizam ul-Mulk and were referred to as Asaf Jahi Nizams, or Nizams of Hyderabad.[38][42] The death of Asaf Jah I in 1748 resulted in a period of political unrest as his sons and grandson—Nasir Jung (1748–1750), Muzaffar Jang (1750–1751) and Salabat Jung (1751–1762)—contended for the throne backed by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces. The accession of Asaf Jah II, who reigned from 1762 to 1803, ended the instability. In 1768 he signed the Treaty of Masulipatam—by which the East India Company in return for a fixed annual rent, got the right to control and collect the taxes at Coromandel Coast.[43]\n In 1769 Hyderabad city became the formal capital of the Asaf Jahi Nizams.[38][42] In response to regular threats from Hyder Ali (Dalwai of Mysore), Baji Rao I (Peshwa of the Maratha Empire), and Basalath Jung (Asaf Jah II's elder brother, who was supported by French General the Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau), the Nizam signed a subsidiary alliance with the East India Company in 1798, allowing the British Indian Army to be stationed at Bolarum (modern Secunderabad) to protect the state's capital, for which the Nizams paid an annual maintenance to the British.[43]\n Until 1874 there were no modern industries in Hyderabad. With the introduction of railways in the 1880s, four factories were built to the south and east of Hussain Sagar lake,[44] and during the early 20th century, Hyderabad was transformed into a modern city with the establishment of transport services, underground drainage, running water, electricity, telecommunications, universities, industries, and Begumpet Airport. The Nizams ruled the princely state of Hyderabad during the British Raj.[38][42]\n After India gained independence, the Nizam declared his intention to remain independent rather than become part of the Indian Union or newly formed Dominion of Pakistan.[43] The Hyderabad State Congress, with the support of the Indian National Congress and the Communist Party of India, began agitating against Nizam VII in 1948. On 17 September that year, the Indian Army took control of Hyderabad State after an invasion codenamed Operation Polo. With the defeat of his forces, Nizam VII capitulated to the Indian Union by signing an Instrument of Accession, which made him the Rajpramukh (Princely Governor) of the state until it was abolished on 31 October 1956.[42][45]\n Between 1946 and 1951, the Communist Party of India fomented the Telangana uprising against the feudal lords of the Telangana region.[46] The Constitution of India, which became effective on 26 January 1950, made Hyderabad State one of the part B states of India, with Hyderabad city continuing to be the capital.[47] In his 1955 report Thoughts on Linguistic States, B. R. Ambedkar, then chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution, proposed designating the city of Hyderabad as the second capital of India because of its amenities and strategic central location.[48]\n On 1 November 1956 the states of India were reorganised by language. Hyderabad state was split into three parts, which were merged with neighbouring states to form Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The nine Telugu- and Urdu-speaking districts of Hyderabad State in the Telangana region were merged with the Telugu-speaking Andhra State to create Andhra Pradesh,[49][50][51] with Hyderabad as its capital. Several protests, known collectively as the Telangana movement, attempted to invalidate the merger and demanded the creation of a new Telangana state. Major actions took place in 1969 and 1972, and a third began in 2010.[52] On 30 July 2013 the government of India declared that part of Andhra Pradesh would be split off to form a new Telangana state and that Hyderabad city would be the capital city and part of Telangana, while the city would also remain the capital of Andhra Pradesh for no more than ten years. On 3 October 2013 the Union Cabinet approved the proposal,[53] and in February 2014 both houses of Parliament passed the Telangana Bill. With the final assent of the President of India, Telangana state was formed on 2 June 2014.\n Hyderabad is 1,566 km (973 mi) south of Delhi, 699 km (434 mi) southeast of Mumbai, and 570 km (350 mi) north of Bangalore by road.[55] It is situated in the southern part of Telangana in southeastern India,[56] along the banks of the Musi River, a tributary of Krishna River located on the Deccan Plateau in the northern part of South India.[57][58][59] Greater Hyderabad covers 650 km2 (250 sq mi), making it one of the largest metropolitan areas in India.[60] With an average altitude of 536 m (1,759 ft), Hyderabad lies on predominantly sloping terrain of grey and pink granite, dotted with small hills, the highest being Banjara Hills at 672 m (2,205 ft).[59] The city has numerous lakes sometime referred to as sagar, meaning \"sea\". Examples include artificial lakes created by dams on the Musi, such as Hussain Sagar (built-in 1562 near the city centre), Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar.[59][61] As of 1996[update], the city had 140 lakes and 834 water tanks (ponds).[62]\n Hyderabad has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen Aw) bordering on a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen BSh).[63] The annual mean temperature is 26.6 °C (79.9 °F); monthly mean temperatures are 21–33 °C (70–91 °F).[64] Summers (March–June) are hot and dry, with average highs in the mid-to-high 30s Celsius;[65] maximum temperatures often exceed 40 °C (104 °F) between April and June.[64] The coolest temperatures occur in December and January when the lowest temperature occasionally dips to 10 °C (50 °F).[64] May is the hottest month when daily temperatures range from 26–39 °C (79–102 °F); December, the coldest, has temperatures varying from 14.5–28 °C (58.1–82.4 °F).[65]\n Heavy rain from the south-west summer monsoon falls between June and October, supplying Hyderabad with most of its mean annual rainfall.[65] Since records began in November 1891, the heaviest rainfall recorded in a 24-hour period was 241.5 mm (10 in) on 24 August 2000. The highest temperature ever recorded was 45.5 °C (114 °F) on 2 June 1966, and the lowest was 6.1 °C (43 °F) on 8 January 1946.[66] The city receives 2,731 hours of sunshine per year; maximum daily sunlight exposure occurs in February.[67]\n Hyderabad has been ranked 21st best \"National Clean Air City\" (under Category 1 >10L Population cities) in India according to 'Swachh Vayu Survekshan 2024 Results'[75]\n Hyderabad's lakes and the sloping terrain of its low-lying hills provide habitat for an assortment of flora and fauna. As of 2016[update], the tree cover is 1.7% of the total city area, a decrease from 2.7% in 1996.[76] The forest region in and around the city encompasses areas of ecological and biological importance, which are preserved in the form of national parks, zoos, mini-zoos and a wildlife sanctuary. Nehru Zoological Park, the city's largest zoo, is the first in India to have a lion and tiger safari park. Hyderabad has three national parks (Mrugavani National Park, Mahavir Harina Vanasthali National Park and Kasu Brahmananda Reddy National Park), and the Manjira Wildlife Sanctuary is about 50 km (31 mi) from the city.\n The other environmental reserves of Hyderabad are Kotla Vijayabhaskara Reddy Botanical Gardens, Ameenpur Lake, Shamirpet Lake, Hussain Sagar, Fox Sagar Lake, Mir Alam Tank and Patancheru Lake, which is home to regional birds and attracts seasonal migratory birds from different parts of the world.[77] Organisations engaged in environmental and wildlife preservation include the Telangana Forest Department,[78] Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), the Animal Welfare Board of India, the Blue Cross of Hyderabad and the University of Hyderabad.[77]\n According to the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 part 2 Section 5:[79] \"(1) On and from the appointed day, Hyderabad in the existing State of Andhra Pradesh, shall be the common capital of the State of Telangana and the State of Andhra Pradesh for such period not exceeding ten years. (2) After the expiry of the period referred to in subsection (1), Hyderabad shall be the capital of the State of Telangana and there shall be a new capital for the State of Andhra Pradesh.\"\n The same sections also define that the common capital includes the existing area designated as the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation under the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act, 1955. As stipulated in sections 3 and 18(1) of the Reorganisation Act, city MLAs are members of the Telangana state assembly.\n The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) oversees the civic infrastructure of the city, there are six administrative zones of GHMC: South Zone–(Charminar), East Zone–(L. B. Nagar), West Zone–(Serilingampally), North Zone–(Kukatpally), Northeast Zone–(Secunderabad) and Central Zone–(Khairatabad); these zones consist of 30 \"circles\", which together encompass 150 municipal wards. Each ward is represented by a corporator, elected by popular vote, as of 2020[update] the city has 7,400,000 voters of which 3,850,000 are male and 3,500,000 are female.[80] The corporators elect the Mayor, who is the titular head of GHMC; executive powers rest with the Municipal Commissioner, appointed by the state government. The GHMC carries out the city's infrastructural work such as building and maintenance of roads and drains, town planning including construction regulation, maintenance of municipal markets and parks, solid waste management, the issuing of birth and death certificates, the issuing of trade licences, collection of property tax, and community welfare services such as mother and child healthcare, and pre-school and non-formal education.[81] The GHMC was formed in April 2007 by merging the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad (MCH) with 12 municipalities of the Hyderabad, Ranga Reddy and Medak districts covering a total area of 650 km2 (250 sq mi).[60]: 3  The Secunderabad Cantonment Board is a civic administration agency overseeing an area of 40.1 km2 (15.5 sq mi),[82]: 93  where there are several military camps.[83]: 2 [84] The Osmania University campus is administered independently by the university authority.[82]: 93  Appointed in February 2021, Gadwal Vijayalakshmi of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is serving as the mayor of GHMC.[85]\n In Hyderabad police jurisdiction is divided into three commissionerates: Hyderabad (established in 1847 AD, the oldest police commissionerate in India[86]), Cyberabad, and Rachakonda, each headed by a commissioner of police, who are Indian Police Service (IPS) officers. The Hyderabad police is a division of the Telangana Police, under the state Home Ministry.[87][88]\n The jurisdictions of the city's administrative agencies are, in ascending order of size: the Hyderabad Police area, Hyderabad district, the GHMC area (\"Hyderabad city\"), and the area under the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA). The HMDA is an apolitical urban planning agency that covers the GHMC and its suburbs, extending to 54 mandals in five districts encircling the city. It coordinates the development activities of GHMC and suburban municipalities and manages the administration of bodies such as the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWSSB).[89]\n Hyderabad is the seat of the Government of Telangana, Government of Andhra Pradesh and the President of India's winter retreat Rashtrapati Nilayam, as well as the Telangana High Court and various local government agencies. The Lower City Civil Court and the Metropolitan Criminal Court are under the jurisdiction of the High Court.[90][91][92]: 1  The GHMC area contains 24 State Legislative Assembly constituencies,[93][94] which form five constituencies of the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Parliament of India).[95]\n The HMWSSB (Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewage Board) regulates rainwater harvesting, sewerage services, and water supply. In 2005, the HMWSSB started operating a 116 km-long (72 mi) water supply pipeline from Nagarjuna Sagar Dam to meet increasing demand.[96][97] The Telangana Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSPDCL) manages electricity supply.[98] As of 2014[update], there were 15 fire stations in the city, operated by the Telangana State Disaster and Fire Response Department.[99] The government-owned India Post has five head post offices and many sub-post offices in Hyderabad, which are complemented by private courier services.[59]\n Hyderabad produces around 4,500 tonnes of solid waste daily, which is transported from collection units in Imlibun, Yousufguda and Lower Tank Bund to the dumpsite in Jawaharnagar.[100] Disposal is managed by the Integrated Solid Waste Management project which was started by the GHMC in 2010.[101] Rapid urbanisation and increased economic activity has led to increased industrial waste, air, noise and water pollution, which is regulated by the Telangana Pollution Control Board (TPCB).[102][103] The contribution of different sources to air pollution in 2006 was: 20–50% from vehicles, 40–70% from a combination of vehicle discharge and road dust, 10–30% from industrial discharges and 3–10% from the burning of household rubbish.[104] Deaths resulting from atmospheric particulate matter are estimated at 1,700–3,000 each year.[105][106][107] The city's \"VIP areas\", the Assembly building, Secretariat, and Telangana chief minister's office, have particularly low air quality index ratings, suffering from high levels of PM2.5's.[108] Ground water around Hyderabad, which has a hardness of up to 1000 ppm, around three times higher than is desirable,[109] is the main source of drinking water but the increasing population and consequent increase in demand has led to a decline in not only ground water but also river and lake levels.[110][111] This shortage is further exacerbated by inadequately treated effluent discharged from industrial treatment plants polluting the water sources of the city.[112]\n The Commissionerate of Health and Family Welfare is responsible for planning, implementation and monitoring of all facilities related to health and preventive services.[113][114] As of 2010[update]–11, the city had 50 government hospitals,[115] 300 private and charity hospitals and 194 nursing homes providing around 12,000 hospital beds, fewer than half the required 25,000.[116] For every 10,000 people in the city, there are 17.6 hospital beds,[117] 9 specialist doctors, 14 nurses and 6 physicians.[116] The city has about 4,000 individual clinics.[118] Private clinics are preferred by many residents because of the distance to, poor quality of care at and long waiting times in government facilities,[119]: 60–61  despite the high proportion of the city's residents being covered by government health insurance: 24% according to a National Family Health Survey in 2005.[119]: 41  As of 2012[update], many new private hospitals of various sizes were opened or being built.[118] Hyderabad has outpatient and inpatient facilities that use Unani, homoeopathic and Ayurvedic treatments.[120]\n In the 2005 National Family Health Survey, it was reported that the city's total fertility rate is 1.8,[119]: 47  which is below the replacement rate. Only 61% of children had been provided with all basic vaccines (BCG, measles and full courses of polio and DPT), fewer than in all other surveyed cities except Meerut.[119]: 98  The infant mortality rate was 35 per 1,000 live births, and the mortality rate for children under five was 41 per 1,000 live births.[119]: 97  The survey also reported that a third of women and a quarter of men are overweight or obese, 49% of children below 5 years are anaemic, and up to 20% of children are underweight,[119]: 44, 55–56  while more than 2% of women and 3% of men suffer from diabetes.[119]: 57 \n When the GHMC was created in 2007, the area occupied by the municipality increased from 175 km2 (68 sq mi) to 650 km2 (250 sq mi).[60][123] Consequently, the population increased by 87%, from 3,637,483 as of 2001[update] census to 6,809,970 as of 2011[update] census, 24% of which are migrants from elsewhere in India,[83]: 2  making Hyderabad the nation's fourth most populous city.[1][3] As of 2011[update], the population density is 18,480/km2 (47,900/sq mi)[124] and the Hyderabad urban agglomeration had a population of 7,749,334 making it the sixth most populous urban agglomeration in the country.[3] as of 2011[update] census, there are 3,500,802 male and 3,309,168 female citizens—a sex ratio of 945 females per 1000 males, higher than the national average of 926 per 1000.[125][126] Among children aged 0–6 years, 373,794 are boys and 352,022 are girls—a ratio of 942 per 1000. Literacy stands at 83% (male 86%; female 80%), higher than the national average of 74.04%.[125][127] The socio-economic strata consist of 20% upper class, 50% middle class and 30% working class.[128]\n Referred to as \"Hyderabadi\", the residents of Hyderabad are predominantly Telugu and Urdu speaking people, with minority Arab, Marathi, Marwari, and Pathan communities.[129]\n Hyderabadi Muslims are a unique community who owe much of their history, language, cuisine, and culture to Hyderabad, and the various dynasties who previously ruled.[130][131] Hadhrami Arabs, African Arabs, Armenians, Abyssinians, Iranians, Pathans and Turkish people were present before 1948; these communities, of which the Hadhrami Arabs are the largest, declined after Hyderabad State became part of the Indian Union, as they lost the patronage of the Asaf Jahi Nizams.[129][132][133]\n Hindus are in the majority. Muslims form a very large minority and are present throughout the city and predominate in and around the Old City of Hyderabad. There are also Christian, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist and Parsi communities and iconic churches, mosques and temples.[135] According to the 2011[update] census, the religious make-up of Greater Hyderabad was: Hindus (64.9%), Muslims (30.1%), Christians (2.8%), Jains (0.3%), Sikhs (0.3%) and Buddhists (0.1%); 1.5% did not state any religion.[136]\n Telugu and Urdu are both official languages of the city, and most Hyderabadis are bilingual.[138] The Telugu dialect spoken in Hyderabad is called Telangana Mandalika, and the Urdu spoken is called Deccani.[139]: 1869–70 [140] English is a \"Secondary official language\" is pervasive in business and administration, and it is an important medium of instruction in education and publications.[141]\n As of 2012, in the greater metropolitan area, 13% of the population live below the poverty line.[142] According to a 2012 report submitted by GHMC to the World Bank, Hyderabad has 1,476 slums with a total population of 1.7 million, of whom 66% live in 985 slums in the \"core\" of the city (the part that formed Hyderabad before the April 2007 expansion) and the remaining 34% live in 491 suburban tenements.[143] About 22% of the slum-dwelling households had migrated from different parts of India in the last decade of the 20th century, and 63% claimed to have lived in the slums for more than 10 years.[83]: 55  Overall literacy in the slums is 60–80% and female literacy is 52–73%. A third of the slums have basic service connections, and the remainder depend on general public services provided by the government. There are 405 government schools, 267 government-aided schools, 175 private schools, and 528 community halls in the slum areas.[144]: 70  According to a 2008 survey by the Centre for Good Governance, 87.6% of the slum-dwelling households are nuclear families, 18% are very poor, with an income up to ₹20,000 (US$240) per annum, 73% live below the poverty line (a standard poverty line recognised by the Andhra Pradesh Government is ₹24,000 (US$280) per annum), 27% of the chief wage earners (CWE) are casual labour and 38% of the CWE are illiterate. About 3.7% of the slum children aged 5–14 do not go to school and 3.2% work as child labour, of whom 64% are boys and 36% are girls. The largest employers of child labour are street shops and construction sites. Among the working children, 35% are engaged in hazardous jobs.[83]: 59 \n The historic city established by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah on the southern side of the Musi River forms the heritage region of Hyderabad called the Purana Shahar (Old City), while the \"New City\" encompasses the urbanised area on the northern banks. The two are connected by many bridges across the river, the oldest of which is Purana Pul—(\"old bridge\") built in 1578 AD.[145] Hyderabad is twinned with neighbouring Secunderabad, to which it is connected by Hussain Sagar.[146]\n Many historic and heritage sites lie in south central Hyderabad, such as the Charminar, Mecca Masjid, Salar Jung Museum, Nizam Museum, Telangana High Court, Falaknuma Palace, Chowmahalla Palace and the traditional retail corridor comprising the Pearl Market, Laad Bazaar and Madina Circle. North of the river are hospitals, colleges, major railway stations and business areas such as Begum Bazaar, Koti, Abids, Sultan Bazar and Moazzam Jahi Market, along with administrative and recreational establishments such as the Telangana Secretariat, the India Government Mint, the Telangana Legislature, the Public Gardens, Shahi Masjid, the Nizam Club, the Ravindra Bharathi, the State Museum, the Birla Temple and the Birla Planetarium.[146][147][148]\n North of central Hyderabad lies Hussain Sagar, Tank Bund Road, Rani Gunj and the Secunderabad railway station.[146] Most of the city's parks and recreational centres, such as Sanjeevaiah Park, Indira Park, Lumbini Park, NTR Gardens, the Buddha statue and Tankbund Park are located here.[149] In the northwest part of the city there are upscale residential and commercial areas such as Banjara Hills, Jubilee Hills, Begumpet, Khairtabad, Tolichowki, Jagannath Temple and Miyapur.[150] The northern end contains industrial areas such as Kukatpally, Sanathnagar, Moosapet, Balanagar, Patancheru and Chanda Nagar. The northeast end is dotted with residential areas such as Malkajgiri, Neredmet, A. S. Rao Nagar and Uppal.[146][147][148] In the eastern part of the city lie many defence research centres and Ramoji Film City. The west and southwest regions of the city, dubbed \"Cyberabad\", have grown rapidly since the 1990s and are home to several information technology and bio-pharmaceutical companies. Numerous skyscrapers and high-rise buildings have been constructed in key economic corridors such as Gachibowli, the Financial District, HITEC City, and Kukatpally.[151] The rapid vertical development in these localities has propelled Hyderabad to become the city with the second-highest number of skyscrapers in India.[152] Several landmarks such as the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, Osman Sagar, Himayath Sagar and Kasu Brahmananda Reddy National Park are also located in the west and southwest regions of the city.[153][154]\n Heritage buildings constructed during the Qutb Shahi and Nizam eras showcase Indo-Islamic architecture influenced by Medieval, Mughal and European styles.[7][155] After the 1908 flooding of the Musi River, the city was expanded and civic monuments constructed, particularly during the rule of Mir Osman Ali Khan (the VIIth Nizam), whose patronage of architecture led to him being referred to as the maker of modern Hyderabad.[156][157] In 2012, the government of India declared Hyderabad the first \"Best heritage city of India\".[158]\n Qutb Shahi architecture of the 16th and early 17th centuries followed classical Persian architecture featuring domes and colossal arches.[159] The oldest surviving Qutb Shahi structure in Hyderabad is the ruins of the Golconda Fort built in the 16th century. Most of the historical bazaars that still exist were constructed on the street north of Charminar towards the fort. The Charminar has become an icon of the city; located in the centre of old Hyderabad, it is a square structure with sides 20 m (66 ft) long and four grand arches each facing a road. At each corner stands a 56 m (184 ft)-high minaret. The Charminar, Golconda Fort and the Qutb Shahi tombs are considered to be monuments of national importance in India; in 2010 the Indian government proposed that the sites be listed for UNESCO World Heritage status.[156][160][161]: 11–18 [162]\n Among the oldest surviving examples of Nizam architecture in Hyderabad is the Chowmahalla Palace, which was the seat of royal power. It showcases a diverse array of architectural styles, from the Baroque Harem to its Neoclassical royal court. The other palaces include Falaknuma Palace (inspired by the style of Andrea Palladio), Purani Haveli, King Kothi Palace and Bella Vista Palace all of which were built at the peak of Nizam rule in the 19th century. During Mir Osman Ali Khan's rule, European styles, along with Indo-Islamic, became prominent. These styles are reflected in the Indo-Saracenic style of architecture seen in many civic monuments such as the Hyderabad High Court, Osmania Hospital, City College and the Kacheguda railway station, all designed by Vincent Esch.[163] Other landmark structures of the city constructed during his regin are the State Central Library, the Telangana Legislature, the State Archaeology Museum, Jubilee Hall, and Hyderabad railway station.[156][159][164][165] Other landmarks of note are Paigah Palace, Asman Garh Palace, Basheer Bagh Palace, Errum Manzil and the Spanish Mosque, all constructed by the Paigah family.[161]: 16–17 [166][167]\n Recent estimates of the economy of Hyderabad's metropolitan area have ranged from US$40-US$74 billion (PPP GDP), and have ranked it either fifth- or sixth- most productive metro area of India.[168] Hyderabad is the largest contributor to the gross domestic product (GDP), tax and other revenues, of Telangana, and the sixth largest deposit centre and fourth largest credit centre nationwide, as ranked by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in June 2012.[169] Its per capita annual income in 2011 was ₹44,300 (US$520).[170] As of 2006[update], the largest employers in the city were the state government (113,098 employees) and central government (85,155).[171] According to a 2005 survey, 77% of males and 19% of females in the city were employed.[172] The service industry remains dominant in the city, and 90% of the employed workforce is engaged in this sector.[173]\n Hyderabad's role in the pearl trade has given it the name \"City of Pearls\" and up until the 18th century, the city was the only global trading centre for diamonds known as Golconda diamonds.[34][174][175] Industrialisation began under the Nizams in the late 19th century, helped by railway expansion that connected the city with major ports.[176][177] From the 1950s to the 1970s, Indian enterprises, such as Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Nuclear Fuel Complex (NFC), National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC), Bharat Electronics (BEL), Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL), Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), State Bank of Hyderabad (SBH) and Andhra Bank (AB)[147] were established in the city.[178] The city is home to Hyderabad Securities formerly known as Hyderabad Stock Exchange (HSE),[179] and houses the regional office of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).[180] In 2013, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) facility in Hyderabad was forecast to provide operations and transactions services to BSE-Mumbai by the end of 2014.[181] The growth of the financial services sector has helped Hyderabad evolve from a traditional manufacturing city to a cosmopolitan industrial service centre.[147] Since the 1990s, the growth of information technology (IT), IT-enabled services (ITES), insurance and financial institutions has expanded the service sector, and these primary economic activities have boosted the ancillary sectors of trade and commerce, transport, storage, communication, real estate and retail.[177] As of 2021[update], the IT exports from Hyderabad were ₹ 1,45,522 crore (US$19.66 billion), the city houses 1500 IT and TES companies that provide 628,615 jobs.[182]\n Hyderabad's commercial markets are divided into four sectors: central business districts,[183] sub-central business centres, neighbourhood business centres and local business centres.[184] Many traditional and historic bazaars are located throughout the city, Laad Bazaar being the prominent among all is popular for selling a variety of traditional and cultural antique wares, along with gems and pearls.[185][186]\n The establishment of Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited (IDPL), a public sector undertaking, in 1961 was followed over the decades by many national and global companies opening manufacturing and research facilities in the city.[187] As of 2010[update], the city manufactured one third of India's bulk drugs and 16% of biotechnology products,[188][189] contributing to its reputation as \"India's pharmaceutical capital\" and the \"Genome Valley of India\".[190] Hyderabad is a global centre of information technology, for which it is known as Cyberabad (Cyber City).[153][154] As of 2013[update], it contributed 15% of India's and 98% of Andhra Pradesh's exports in IT and ITES sectors[191] and 22% of NASSCOM's total membership is from the city.[170] The development of HITEC City, a township with extensive technological infrastructure, prompted multinational companies to establish facilities in Hyderabad.[153] The city is home to more than 1300 IT and ITES firms that provide employment for 407,000 individuals; the global conglomerates include Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google, IBM, Yahoo!, Oracle Corporation, Dell, Facebook, CISCO,[83]: 3 [192] and major Indian firms including Tech Mahindra, Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Polaris, Cyient and Wipro.[83]: 3  In 2009 the World Bank Group ranked the city as the second best Indian city for doing business.[193] The city and its suburbs contain the highest number of special economic zones of any Indian city.[170]\n The Automotive industry in Hyderabad is also emerging and making it an automobile hub.[194] Automobile companies including as Hyundai, Hyderabad Allwyn, Praga Tools, HMT Bearings, Ordnance Factory Medak, Deccan Auto and Mahindra & Mahindra have units in the Hyderabad economic zone.[195] Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Maruti Suzuki and Triton Energy will invest in Hyderabad.[196]\n Like the rest of India, Hyderabad has a large informal economy that employs 30% of the labour force.[144]: 71  According to a survey published in 2007, it had 40–50,000 street vendors, and their numbers were increasing.[197]: 9  Among the street vendors, 84% are male and 16% female,[198]: 12  and four fifths are \"stationary vendors\" operating from a fixed pitch, often with their own stall.[198]: 15–16  Most are financed through personal savings; only 8% borrow from moneylenders.[198]: 19  Vendor earnings vary from ₹50 (59¢ US) to ₹800 (US$9.50) per day.[197]: 25  Other unorganised economic sectors include dairy, poultry farming, brick manufacturing, casual labour and domestic help. Those involved in the informal economy constitute a major portion of the urban poor.[144]: 71 [199]\n In 2024, the World Economic Forum established a Centre for Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR), in the city. Which it describes as a hub to leverage the latest technology in advancing the life sciences and health sectors.[200]\n Hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in India with the decline of the Mughal Empire. After the fall of Delhi in 1857, the migration of performing artists to the city particularly from the north and west of the Indian subcontinent, under the patronage of the Nizam, enriched the cultural milieu.[201][202] This migration resulted in a mingling of North and South Indian languages, cultures and religions, which has since led to a co-existence of Hindu and Muslim traditions, for which the city has become noted.[203][204][205]: viii  A further consequence of this north–south mix is that both Telugu and Urdu are official languages of Telangana.[206] The mixing of religions has resulted in many festivals being celebrated in Hyderabad such as Ganesh Chaturthi, Diwali and Bonalu of Hindu tradition and Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha by Muslims.[207]\n Traditional Hyderabadi garb reveals a mix of Muslim and Hindu influences with men wearing sherwani and kurta–paijama and women wearing khara dupatta and salwar kameez.[208][209][210] Most Muslim women wear burqa and hijab outdoors.[211] In addition to the traditional Hindu and Muslim garments, increasing exposure to western cultures has led to a rise in the wearing of western style clothing among youths.[212]\n In the past, Qutb Shahi rulers and Asaf Jahi Nizams attracted artists, architects, and men of letters from different parts of the world through patronage. The resulting ethnic mix popularised cultural events such as mushairas (poetic symposia), Qawwali (devotional songs) and Dholak ke Geet (traditional folk songs).[213][214][215] The Qutb Shahi dynasty particularly encouraged the growth of Deccani literature leading to works such as the Deccani Masnavi and Diwan poetry, which are among the earliest available manuscripts in Urdu.[216] Lazzat Un Nisa, a book compiled in the 15th century at Qutb Shahi courts, contains erotic paintings with diagrams for secret medicines and stimulants in the eastern form of ancient sexual arts.[217] The reign of the Asaf Jahi Nizams saw many literary reforms and the introduction of Urdu as a language of court, administration and education.[218] In 1824, a collection of Urdu Ghazal poetry, named Gulzar-e-Mahlaqa, authored by Mah Laqa Bai—the first female Urdu poet to produce a Diwan—was published in Hyderabad.[219] Hyderabad has continued with these traditions in its annual Hyderabad Literary Festival, held since 2010, showcasing the city's literary and cultural creativity.[220] Organisations engaged in the advancement of literature include the Sahitya Akademi, the Urdu Academy, the Telugu Academy, the National Council for Promotion of Urdu Language, the Comparative Literature Association of India, and the Andhra Saraswata Parishad. Literary development is further aided by state institutions such as the State Central Library, the largest public library in the state which was established in 1891,[221] and other major libraries including the Sri Krishna Devaraya Andhra Bhasha Nilayam, the British Library and the Sundarayya Vignana Kendram.[222]\n South Indian music and dances such as the Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam styles are popular in the Deccan region. As a result of their cultural policies, North Indian music and dance gained popularity during the rule of the Mughals and Nizams,[223] and it was also during their reign that it became a tradition among the nobility to associate themselves with tawaif (courtesans). These courtesans were revered as the epitome of etiquette and culture and were appointed to teach singing, poetry, and classical dance to many children of the aristocracy.[224] This gave rise to certain styles of court music, dance and poetry. Besides western and Indian popular music genres such as filmi music, the residents of Hyderabad play city-based marfa music, Dholak ke Geet (household songs based on local folklore), and qawwali, especially at weddings, festivals and other celebratory events.[225][226] The state government organises the Golconda Music and Dance Festival, the Taramati Music Festival and the Premavathi Dance Festival to further encourage the development of music.[227]\n Although the city is not particularly noted for theatre and drama,[228] the state government promotes theatre with multiple programmes and festivals[229][230] in such venues as the Ravindra Bharathi, Shilpakala Vedika, Lalithakala Thoranam and Lamakaan. Although not a purely music-oriented event, Numaish, a popular annual exhibition of local and national consumer products, does feature some musical performances.[231]\n The city is home to the Telugu film industry, popularly known as Tollywood—as of 2021[update] it is the highest-grossing Indian film industry.[232] In the 1970s, Deccani language realist films by globally acclaimed Shyam Benegal started a movement of coming of age art films in India, which came to be known as parallel cinema.[233] The Deccani film industry (\"Dollywood\") produces films in the local Hyderabadi dialect, which have gained regional popularity since 2005.[234] The city has hosted international film festivals such as the International Children's Film Festival and the Hyderabad International Film Festival.[235] In 2005, Guinness World Records declared Ramoji Film City to be the world's largest film studio.[236]\n The region is well known for its Golconda and Hyderabad painting styles which are branches of Deccan painting.[237] Developed during the 16th century, the Golconda style is a native style blending foreign techniques and bears some similarity to the Vijayanagara paintings of neighbouring Mysore. A significant use of luminous gold and white colours is generally found in the Golconda style.[238] The Hyderabad style originated in the 17th century under the Nizams. Highly influenced by Mughal painting, this style makes use of bright colours and mostly depicts regional landscape, culture, costumes, and jewellery.[237]\n Although not a centre for handicrafts itself, the patronage of the arts by the Mughals and Nizams attracted artisans from the region to Hyderabad. Such crafts include: Wootz steel, Filigree work, Bidriware, a metalwork handicraft from neighbouring Karnataka, which was popularised during the 18th century and has since been granted a Geographical Indication (GI) tag under the auspices of the WTO act;[156][239] and Zari and Zardozi, embroidery works on textile that involve making elaborate designs using gold, silver and other metal threads.[240] Chintz—a glazed calico textiles was originated in Golconda in 16th century.[241][242] and another example of a handicraft drawn to Hyderabad is Kalamkari, a hand-painted or block-printed cotton textile that comes from cities in Andhra Pradesh. This craft is distinguished in having both a Hindu style, known as Srikalahasti and entirely done by hand, and an Islamic style, known as Machilipatnam which uses both hand and block techniques.[243] Examples of Hyderabad's arts and crafts are housed in various museums including the Salar Jung Museum (housing \"one of the largest one-man-collections in the world\"[244]), the Telangana State Archaeology Museum, the Nizam Museum, the City Museum and the Birla Science Museum.[245]\n Hyderabadi cuisine comprises a broad repertoire of rice, wheat and meat dishes and the skilled use of various spices.[246] Hyderabad is listed by UNESCO as a creative city of gastronomy.[247][248] Hyderabadi biryani and Hyderabadi haleem, with their blend of Mughlai and Arab cuisines,[249] carry the national Geographical Indications tag.[250] Hyderabadi cuisine is influenced to some extent by French,[251] but more by Arabic, Turkish, Iranian and native Telugu and Marathwada cuisines.[210][249] Popular native dishes include nihari, chakna, baghara baingan and the desserts qubani ka meetha, double ka meetha and kaddu ki kheer (a sweet porridge made with sweet gourd).[210][252]\n One of Hyderabad's earliest newspapers, The Deccan Times, was established in the 1780s.[253] Major Telugu dailies published in Hyderabad are Eenadu, Sakshi and Namasthe Telangana, while major English papers are The Times of India, The Hindu and Deccan Chronicle. The major Urdu papers include The Siasat Daily, The Munsif Daily and Etemaad.[254][255] The Secunderabad Cantonment Board established the first radio station in Hyderabad State around 1919. Deccan Radio was the first radio public broadcast station in the city starting on 3 February 1935,[256] with FM broadcasting beginning in 2000.[257] The available channels in Hyderabad include All India Radio, Radio Mirchi, Radio City, Red FM, Big FM and Fever FM.[258]\n Television broadcasting in Hyderabad began in 1974 with the launch of Doordarshan, the government of India's public service broadcaster,[259] which transmits two free-to-air terrestrial television channels and one satellite channel. Private satellite channels started in July 1992 with the launch of Star TV.[260] Satellite TV channels are accessible via cable subscription, direct-broadcast satellite services or internet-based television.[257][261] Hyderabad's first dial-up internet access became available in the early 1990s and was limited to software development companies.[262] The first public internet access service began in 1995, with the first private sector internet service provider (ISP) starting operations in 1998.[263] In 2015, high-speed public WiFi was introduced in parts of the city.[264]\n Public and private schools in Hyderabad are governed by the Board of Secondary Education, Telangana or Central Board of Secondary Education, depending on the affiliation and follow a \"10+2+3\" plan. About two-thirds of pupils attend privately run institutions.[265] Languages of instruction include English, Hindi, Telugu and Urdu.[266] Depending on the institution, students are required to sit the Secondary School Certificate[267] or the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education. After completing secondary education, students enrol in schools or junior colleges with higher secondary facilities. Admission to professional graduation colleges in Hyderabad, many of which are affiliated with either Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad (JNTUH) or Osmania University (OU), is through the Engineering Agricultural and Medical Common Entrance Test (EAM-CET).[268][269]\n There are 13 universities in Hyderabad: six private universities, two deemed universities, six state universities, and three central universities. The central universities are the University of Hyderabad (Hyderabad Central University, HCU),[270] Maulana Azad National Urdu University and the English and Foreign Languages University.[271] Osmania University, established in 1918, was the first university in Hyderabad and as of 2012[update] is India's second most popular institution for international students.[272] The Dr. B. R.

    "text": "\n \n Hyderabadi cuisine (native: Hyderabadi Ghizaayat), also known as Deccani cuisine, is the cooking style characteristic of the city of Hyderabad and its surrounding area in Telangana, India.\n Hyderabadi cuisine is an amalgamation of South Asian, Mughalai, Turkic, and Arabic also influenced by the culinary habits of common people in the Golconda Sultanate.[1] Hyderabadi cuisine comprises a broad repertoire of rice, wheat, and meat dishes and the skilled use of various spices, herbs and natural edibles.[2]: 3 [3]: 14 [4]\n The haute cuisine of Hyderabad began to develop after the foundation of the Bahmani Sultanate, and the Qutb Shahi dynasty centered in the city of Hyderabad promoted the native cuisine along with their own. Hyderabadi cuisine had become a princely legacy of the Nizams of Hyderabad as it began to further develop under their patronage.\nHyderabadi cuisine has different recipes for different events, and hence is categorized accordingly, from banquet food, to weddings and parties, festival foods, and travel foods. The category to which the recipe belongs itself speaks of different things like the time required to prepare the food, the shelf life of the prepared item, etc.[5]\n The Deccan region is an inland area in India. The native cuisine was prominent until the Vijayanagara Empire lasted, it was during the rule of Delhi Sultanate, Muhammad bin Tughluq when he shifted the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad, the Deccan region adopted the foreign cuisines. In the 14th century when the Bahmani Sultanate was formed by revolting against the Delhi Sultanate in Deccan, the Turkish noblemen were appointed in the high positions, and introduced the Turkish cuisine.\n The two-centuries-long political instability in the region of the Deccan and the main Central Mughal authority and migration has introduced Deccan with multiple foreign cuisines.[6]: 91–92 [7]: 31 \n In Deccan medieval cuisine, banquets were common among the aristocracy. Multiple courses would be prepared and served in a style called Dastarkhān (A long cloth laid on the floor on which food dishes and dinners plates are placed). Food was generally eaten by hand, served on among commons and nobility. The food was mostly meat oriented being grilled and fried in tandoor. The curry were highly seasoned and flavored by using spices. Fruits were preferred rather than dessert after main course. Once the meals are ended Kahwa (liquid hot drink) was consumed that contains ingredients to digest food. The ingredients of the cuisine varied greatly according to the seasons and festivals, and many items were preserved in the form of Pickles.[6]: 91–92 [7]: 31 [8]\n The modern cuisine was evolved during the Nizams in the mid-17th century, and elevated to a sublime art form. Hyderabad has a history of continuous influx of migrants from all over the world and in general from the Indian sub-continent, particularly since 1857. Most of the foreign food had been improved to suit the culinary preferences, resulting to form the unique derivative cuisine that excels over the original. Biryani and Haleem (Arabic) for instance is prepared all over India, but the Hyderabadi variety is ultimately from the Hyderabadi Biryani and Hyderabadi Haleem. Til ke chatuni with Arabic tahini, Persian dried lamb with beans is modified with dalcha, tandoori naan of Uzbek (Central Asia) to create Sheermal. Most of the modern day desserts in Hyderabadi cuisine were introduced and invented during the times of Nizams, today that had become an integral part of cuisine.[7]: 31 [8]\n Hyderabadi cuisine is an integral part of the cuisines of the former Hyderabad State that includes the state of Telangana and the regions of Marathwada (now in Maharashtra) and Kalyana-Karanataka (now in Karnataka). The Hyderabadi cuisine contains city-specific specialties like Hyderabad (Hyderabadi biryani and Hyderabadi Haleem) and Aurangabad (Naan Qalia), Parbhani (Biryani and Tahari), Bidar (Kalyani Biryani) and others. The use of dry coconut, tamarind, and red chillies along with other spices are the main ingredients that make Hyderabadi cuisine different from the North Indian cuisine.[7]: 31 [8]\n Hyderabadi dinner also known as Dastarkhwan are usually of five course meal; Aghaz (Soup), Mezban (appetizers), Waqfa (Sorbet), Mashgool Dastarkhwan (Main course) and Zauq-e-shahi (dessert).[9]\n Lukhmi is a regional non-vegetarian variation of the samosa, though it is shaped into a flat square patty. It is made from flour and stuffed with minced mutton or beef, known as kheema. It is eaten as an evening snack or served as a starter at celebrations.[10][11]\n Murtabak is often described as spicy folded omelette pancake with bits of vegetables. It is the most common form of Murtabak; which is egg-filled pancake, sometimes mixed with green onion and minced meat, made from pan fried crepes which is folded and cut to squares.[12]\n Hyderabadi Haleem is a popular dish of Hyderabad. It is a stew composed of mutton, lentils, spices and wheat.[13] It originates from Harees, an Arab dish brought to Hyderabad by Arab migrants. Harees is still prepared in its original form in Barkas.[14] It is sometimes served as a starter at celebrations, but it is usually only prepared during the month of Ramadan for the Iftar meal.[15]\n Hyderabadi Biryani is one of the most popular dishes of the city. It is distinctly different from other variations of the Biryani, originating from the kitchens of the Nizams of Hyderabad. It is a celebration dish of basmati rice and mutton, along with yoghurt, onions and various spices.[16][17][18] It is a key dish to the cuisine and it is said that the dish is considered synonymous with the city of Hyderabad.[19]\n Pathar-ka-gosht is a mutton kebab. It is named for the traditional method of preparation, on a stone slab. (Pathar means 'stone' in Urdu as well as Hindi.)[24]\n The Hyderabadi version of khichdi is distinct from the many variants in other parts of India. It is eaten with kheema (minced mutton curry). It is consumed as a breakfast item, as well as during the month of Ramadan for the Sehri meal.\n While most khichdi preparations use toor or moong dal, the Hyderabadi version uses masoor dal. Also, turmeric doesn’t feature in the ingredients list although some people use it in the modern preparations. The colouring of the dish comes from the caramelized onions that are an important flavour of the dish.\nAs opposed to the semi-liquid, moist preparation of khichdi elsewhere in the country, the dish made here has a drier texture, and each grain of rice stands out. — Nawab Mehboob Alam Khan, culinary expert[25] Tala huwa gosht, or talawa gosht (in Hyderabadi dialect) is a simple mutton or beef[26] dish usually accompanied by khatti dal. It may be eaten with roti or rice.[27]\n",

    "text": "\n The economy of Hyderabad, the capital of Telangana, India, is based on traditional manufacturing, the knowledge sector and tourism.[1] Starting in the 1990s, the economic pattern of the city changed from a primary service hub to a more diversified economy,[2] but the service industry still remains a major contributor.[3] As of 2006, the largest employers of Hyderabad are the governments of Andhra Pradesh and India, with 113,000 and 85,000 employees, respectively.[4][5]\n Since its inception in 1591, Hyderabad has been a global trade center in multiple areas, including its status as the world's only diamond market. City-based handicrafts were sold in the Middle East and Western countries. During the rule of the Nizam's in the 1930s, industrial growth started with the establishment of a diversified industrial zone, which grew in parallel with traditional manufacturing.\n In the 1930s and 1940s, city-based industries started importing technology from the western world for industrial manufacturing. With the introduction of the railways, the city became well connected with the port cities of Bombay (now Mumbai), Madras (now Chennai), Calcutta (now Kolkata), and Karachi (now in Pakistan).[6][7] During the 1950s and 1960s, most of the Indian premier public enterprises—BHEL, NMDC, HMT, BEL, IDPL, ECIL, DRDO, and HAL—were established in Hyderabad, changing the economical pattern of the city from a traditional manufacturing to a cosmopolitan industrial service sector.[8]\n Hyderabad, being the capital of Telangana, is the largest contributor to the state's GDP (Gross domestic product) and state tax.[9] In 2011, Hyderabad generated revenues of ₹700,000 million (US$8.3 billion) and contributed a third of the state's tax revenue.[10] In 2023, the GDP  was US$ 83.5 billion, ranking it as the seventh most productive metro area in India.[11][12][13][3] Hyderabad and its suburbs house the highest number of special economic zones among India's cities.[14]\n In the 1970s, the pharmaceutical and electronic industries were established in the city because of its strategic location in south-central India, for which it is known as the gateway to south-central India.[8][15][16] Since the 1990s, the economic patterns of the city have changed it from a primary service hub to a more diversified spectrum,[2] with the growth of IT enterprises, biotech, insurance, and financial institutions, and a strong employment base in ancillary activities such as trade and commerce, transport, storage, communication, real-estate and retail, which employ three times more people than the IT industries.[7] As of 2022, Hyderabad has 7,78,121 employees in the IT/ITES sector, working in more than 1500 companies.[17][18][19][20] The service industry in this arena remains dominant, with 90% of the workforce.[16][21] As of 2005, out of every 1000 people of working age, 770 males and 190 females are employed.[22]\n In March 2012, The Indian Union Tourism Ministry declared Hyderabad as the first ever \"Best Heritage City of India\".[23]\n Hyderabad was the World's third best city to visit in 2013, according to Lonely Planet.  In 2011 the city was ranked nineteenth in the world by The New York Times in The list of 41 Places to Go in 2011, the only Indian City in the list.[24] Hyderabad is known as the City of Pearls, due to the presence of pearls trading industry—until the 18th century the city was the only global trade center of large diamonds.[25][26] Many traditional and historical bazaars are located in the city.[27][28] The Laad Bazaar and nearby markets have shops that sell pearls, diamonds and other traditional ware and cultural antiques.[27]\n Hyderabad emerged as a pharmaceutical and biotechnology hub and is known as India's pharmaceutical capital and \"Genome Valley of India\".[29][30] In 2008–2009, Hyderabad's bio-pharmaceuticals exports reached US$3.1 billion.[31] The south—central location of Hyderabad, and the incorporation of Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited (IDPL) in 1961 proved to be a foundation of pharmaceutical industry in Hyderabad, later in the 1990s the expansion in the industry took place with the formation of Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology and National Institute of Nutrition along with the regional institutions making Hyderabad the hub of pharmaceutical and biotechnology in India.[32][33]\n The establishment of the public sector in biotechnology and the Genome Valley, Fab City and the Nano Technology Park established significant infrastructure in bio-technology. These attributes attracted regional companies and MNCs to set up offices, warehouses, research and development centres in the city.[34] In 2012, the city hosted the Convention on Biological Diversity (2012 COP 11).[35]\n The commercial market structure of Hyderabad is defined into 4 sectors—The Central Business Districts (CBD), the sub-central business centres, the neighbourhood business centres and local business centres.[36] Since 2007, the retail industry in Hyderabad is on the rise,[37] and several central business districts are spread across the city.[38][39]\n The World Bank Group ranked the city as the second-best Indian city for doing business in 2009.[40] In 2020, the economic analysis group GaWC ranked Hyderabad in its second tier (Beta- World City) of cities by importance.[41] In 2011, DTZ ranked Hyderabad as world's third most affordable office location,[42] while Business Today ranked Hyderabad as the fourth best city to live in India.[43] Hyderabad witnessed a high growth in the real estate business, making it among the top five concentrated cities for housing in India.[44] In 2007–08, the city's prime residential areas of Banjara Hills and Jubilee Hills reached the highest growth percentage in India. The Economic Times evaluated Banjara Hills to be worth US$20.7 billion.[45]\n Hyderabad experienced a significant construction boom beginning in the lata 2010s, especially concentrated in the western areas near its IT corridor. The growth was fuelled by the arrival of numerous tech companies, rising levels of foreign investment, and a growing upper-middle-class demographic.[46] State-driven initiatives like the Telangana Building Permission Approval and Self-Certification System (TS-bPASS) played a key role in this expansion by simplifying the process of getting approvals for high-rise developments.[47]\n By 2025, Hyderabad had grown to the distinction of having the second-largest number of skyscrapers in India, second only to Mumbai.[48] Hyderabad features at least 20 skyscrapers rising to a height greater than 150 metres (492 ft), with SAS Crown being the tallest building in Hyderabad.[49] The city's ever-changing skyline continues to reflect its rapid development and evolution into one of the biggest economic hubs in India.[50]\n Hyderabad is among the global centres of information technology for which it is known as Cyberabad (Cyber City).[51][52] The city's IT sector includes the IT-enabled services, business process outsourcing, entertainment industries,[52] and Financial services.[53] During 2008–09, Hyderabad's IT exports reached US$ 4.7 billion,[31] and 22% of the NASSCOM's total membership is from Hyderabad.[14] The development of a township with related technological infrastructure called HITEC City prompted global and particularly US—based companies to establish their operations in Hyderabad.[51] The Deloitte, Franklin Templeton Investments, GE Capital, Accenture, HSBC, Bank of America, ABN AMRO, S&P Global, Ernst & Young, KPMG, Capgemini, Genpact are some of the financial services companies with offices in the city.[53] In Hyderabad, the central region of the business happens in Nanakramguda Financial District, HITECH City, the Madhapur suburb, Kokapet SEZ (Neopolis) and Salarpuria Sattva Knowledge City.\n As of 2022, Hyderabad has 778,121 employees in the IT/ITES sector, working in more than 1500 companies.[17][54][55][56] Hyderabad added two companies in unicorn startup list in first two months of 2022.[57] The IT exports from Hyderabad (Telangana) stood second in India at ₹183,569  crore (US$23 billion) in FY 2021-22 improving from previous year.[58][59] The major multinational IT firms located in Hyderabad are Microsoft (the largest R&D campus outside the US), Google, Thoughtworks, CA Technologies, Amazon, IBM, Motorola, Samsung, Agilent, ADP, Oracle Corporation, Yahoo!, Dell, Texas Instruments, Hewlett-Packard, Virtusa, Kewill, Facebook and others.[53][60][61][62] The major Indian firms with development centres in the city are Tech Mahindra, Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant, Recykal, Tata Consultancy Services, Polaris, and others.[53] The main areas where such IT and ITeS campuses have been set up are Madhapur, Gachibowli, Kondapur and Uppal.[63][64][65] Apple announced the opening of a new office in Hyderabad that will focus on development of its Maps product.[66]\n The Information Technology Investment Region (ITIR), Hyderabad is an upcoming IT investment region jointly being developed by the government of India and Government of Telangana.[67] The union government has given in-principle approval on Sept 8th, 2012 for the Information Technology Investment Region (ITIR) for development of self-contained integrated knowledge clusters for growth of IT and electronic hardware manufacturing in 50,000 acres in and around Hyderabad.[68] The project which is modeled along the lines of Shenzhen SEZ in China, is aimed at attracting an investment of Rs 2.19 trillion ($44 billion) in the IT, ITES and electronics sectors and providing direct employment to 1.5 million people.[citation needed]\n Under the mega project, special economic zones (SEZs), industrial parks, free trade zones, warehousing zones and export-oriented units would come up in three corridors around the city which includes the areas Madhapur, Gachibowli, Uppal, Mamidipalli, Raviryal, Adibatla and Maheswaram, and Pocharam. The Indian government proposed to develop the infrastructure for ITIR at an estimated cost of over Rs 2.19 lakh crore.[69]\n On 20 September 2013 the central government gave the official approval for the ITIR project[70]\n In April 2016, the central government informed Telangana state government that it would revise the entire plan. This, according to sources, may lead to the delay in the estimated investments of Rs 3 lakh crore and creation of nearly 60 lakh jobs. No explanation was given as why such a revision was required.[citation needed]\n In 1942, Hyderabad Allwyn was established in Hyderabad as city's first auto-components manufacturing and assembling unit.  The cities strategic geographical location had attracted national and multinational companies to start up there operations, manufacturing, research and development centers in and around the city, transforming Hyderabad into emerging hub of the automobile industry that includes the electric vehicle industry.[71][72][73]\n In present times, the Hyderabad economic zone houses national and multinational companies such as; Hyundai, Hyderabad Allwyn, Praga Tools, HMT Bearings, Ordnance Factory Medak, Tata Boeing Aerospace, Deccan Auto and Mahindra & Mahindra.[74] Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Maruti Suzuki and Triton Energy will invest in Hyderabad.[75]\n",

    "text": "\n \n The culture of Hyderabad, also known as Hyderabadi Tehzeeb (حیدرآبادي تہذیب ) or Dakhini Tehzeeb (دکني تہذیب ),[1] is the traditional cultural lifestyle of the Hyderabadi Muslims, and characterizes distinct linguistic and cultural traditions of North and South India, which meet and mingle in the city and erstwhile kingdom.[2] This blending was the result of the geographic location of the region and the variety of historical dynasties that ruled the city across different periods—its inception by the Qutub Shahi dynasty in 1591 AD, the occupation by the Mughal Empire and its decline, and the patronage under the Asaf Jahi dynasty.\n The city is historically known for its Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb, which refers to unity and co-existence of Hindu and Muslim cultures and traditions. Apart from a few instances of communal violence, the majority of the city residents advocate communal harmony between Hyderabadi Muslims and Telugu people, the two main religious and cultural groups found in the city.[3][4][5][6]\n Apart from Hyderabad, Hyderabadi Culture is also seen in communities in Bidar, Vijayawada, Gulbarga, Bijapur, Guntur, Latur and Aurangabad. These used to be a part of the erstwhile Hyderabad State, hence, the culture is prevalent in the areas, especially among Dakhini Muslims.\n Hyderabadis, as residents of the city are known, may be either Urdu or Telugu speaking.\n[7] The traditional Hyderabadi garb is Sherwani Kurta Paijama, and Lungi for men,[8] Sarees, Khara Dupatta and Salwar kameez for women.[9][10] Burqa and Hijab is commonly practised among the Muslim women in public.[11] Most of the youth wear western clothing.[12] Public carnivals celebrated in Hyderabad include the,[13] Ganesh Chaturthi,[14] Bonalu, Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, Milad Un Nabi\n Hyderabad city as the former capital of Hyderabad State had received the royal patronage for arts, literature and architecture by the former rulers, also attracting men of letters and arts from different parts of the world to get settled in the city. Such multi-ethnic settlements popularised multi cultural events such as Mushairas, literary and stage drama.[15] Besides the popularity of Western and other Indian popular musics such as the filmi music, the residents of Hyderabad play city based Marfa Music which had become an integral part of every event.[16][17] The Osmania University and University of Hyderabad offers Masters and Doctoral (PhD) level programs in classical languages, modern languages, dance, theatre arts, painting, fine art and communication.[18][19] The Ravindra Bharati, Shilpakala Vedika and Lalithakala Thoranam are well-known auditoria for theatre and performing arts in the city.[20] Another prominent cultural centre is Lamakaan, known for promoting the arts and regularly hosting a plethora of events and workshops.[21]\n The modern Hyderabad International Convention Centre (HICC), also known as HITEX, constructed with the cost of ₹ 3 billion has become well known venue address internationally.[22] The Hyderabad Literary Festival, held since 2010, is an annual event which showcases the city's literary and cultural aspects.[23] In the year 2010, the first ever International Congress of Mathematicians was organised in the city.[24] Other cultural events include annual Numaish and literary festival for promoting regional Indian literature.[25] Some of the nationally and internationally acclaimed cultural representatives from the city are Sarojini Naidu, Amjad Hyderabadi, M F Hussain,[26] Irshad Panjatan, Talat Aziz, Harsha Bhogle, Sharmila Tagore, Vithal Rao, Shaik Dawood Khan, Janardhan Mitta and Rashid Ali.\n Hyderabad is home to many museums, galleries, and other institutions which are major tourist attractions as well as playing a research role. The first of these to be established was the State Archaeology Museum (former name Hyderabad Museum) in 1930.[27] The other important museums including, the Salar Jung Museum, the Nizam Museum, the City Museum,[28] and the Birla Science Museum which also comprises a planetarium.[29]\n The Salar Jung Museum, which houses \"The world's largest one man collection\",[30] is by far the largest and most famous museum in the city. It is one of the three national museums of India. It houses an impressive collection of artifacts from all over the world, collected by Salar Jung III, who was the Prime Minister of Hyderabad.\nAmong the most notable exhibits are jade-crafted daggers belonging to Jahangir and Shah Jahan, the famous sculpture of Veiled Rebecca and copies of the Quran in various styles and sizes.\n Deccani style painting originated in the 16th century in and around Hyderabad. It contains an insightful native style with the blend of foreign techniques and has a similarity of neighbouring Vijayanagara paintings. The extensive use of luminous, gold and white colours is generally found in Deccani paintings. Due to the Islamic influence in the sultanate the Deccani paintings are mostly of nature with the background of floral and fauna, and the major use of regional landscape is reflected commonly with regional culture. Some Deccani paintings present the historical events of the region.[31][32]\n A Fine art metal handicraft Bidri ware (the skills and techniques which came from Middle East to India during the 14th century), was popularised in Hyderabad during Asif Jahi region in the 18th century. Today the production of Bidriware in Hyderabad and neighbouring Bidar accounts highest in India. The Bidri ware is a Geographical Indication (GI) awarded craft of India.[33] The Kalamkari, a fine art of Handicraft (originated in Machilipatnam 3000 year ago is a Handicraft of Andhra Pradesh) is also popular in the city.[34]\n The Qutb Shahs were regarded as the great patrons of Urdu, Farsi and Telugu language. The region saw a growth of Deccani Urdu literature, the Deccani Masnavi and Diwan composed during those periods are among the earliest available manuscripts in the Urdu language. The literary work of this region is influenced with the regional Marathi, Telugu,[35] and Kannada in parallel with Arabic and Persian including the adoption of poetic meters and a great quantity of renovated words.[36] The Fifth Sultan of the dynasty, Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah was himself an Urdu poet.[37]\n The period of Nizams saw a growth of literary growth since after printing was introduced in Hyderabad. In 1824 AD, the first collection of Urdu Ghazals named Gulzar-e-Mahlaqa (Mahlaqa's garden of flowers) written by Mah Laqa Bai, was printed and published from Hyderabad.[38]\n After the Revolt of 1857, many Urdu writers, scholars and poets who lost their patronage at Delhi made Hyderabad their home, that grew and brought reforms in the literary and poetry work. Scholars continued to migrate to Hyderabad during the reign of Asaf Jah VI and his successor Asaf Jah VII. These included Shibli Nomani, Dagh Dehlvi, Fani Badayuni, Josh Malihabadi, Ali Haider Tabatabai, Zahir Dehlvi and many others.[39][40]\n The reign of Asaf Jah VII saw many reforms in literary work. For the first time in history the Nizams introduced Urdu as a language of court, administration and education. Other notable poets, scholars and writers of the early 20th century are Amjad Hyderabadi,[41] Maharaja Sir Kishen Pershad,[42] Makhdoom Mohiuddin, Sayyid Shamsullah Qadri, Mohiuddin Qadri Zore[43] and Sulaiman Areeb.\n Sarojini Naidu, born and brought up in Hyderabad, was a great admirer of Hyderabadi culture. She described its various aspects in her poems, the most famous of which is \"In the Bazaars of Hyderabad\".[44]\n Since after Indian Independence, the organisation that are working for the development of the literary work are Sahitya Akademi (to promote both Telugu and Urdu in Telangana), Urdu Academy, Telugu Academy, National Council for Promotion of Urdu Language, The Comparative Literature Association of India and Andhra Saraswata Parishad (Former name; Nizam Rashtria Andhra Saraswata Parishad). Along with native languages the city attracts many international languages scholars since after the establishment of English and Foreign Languages University (1972).[45] The State Central Library, Hyderabad (former name Asifia Kutubkhana) since 1891 is the biggest library of Telangana.[46] The other popular libraries in the city are the Sri Krishna Devaraya Andhra Bhasha Nilayam, the British Library[47] and the Sundarayya Vignana Kendram which also houses Urdu research center's collection.[48][49][50]\n In 2017, Urdu was declared the second official language of the state of Telangana. (after Telugu) This move was praised by many residents of the area, especially Muslims of Hyderabad who spoke Urdu as their mother tongue.[51][52]\n Since inception of Hyderabad, the nobles have a tradition of courtesans dance and poetry, which had led to a unique style of dance form in court dance in Hyderabad, the Taramati of the early 16th century and Mah Laqa Bai 18th century are some of the early courtesans who popularised Kathak dance and poetry culture in the early history of Hyderabad. Some of the dance festivals organised by the AP Government are; Golconda Music and Dance Festival, The Taramati Music Festival, The Premavathi Dance Festival.[38][53]\n The residents of Hyderabad, in the past were not much trendy in theatre and drama, though artists like Baban Khan had been internationally recognised for their theatrical work.[54] It was in the last few decades that the Department of Culture and the Theatre Development Department of Andhra Pradesh Government had applied efforts to promote the art of theatre with multiple programs and festivals.[55] The result of which that most of the youths have been evolved in the theatre art and drama and it is gaining popularity among the residents.[56]\n The city is home to many Qawwals, that keep the age-old tradition of Qawwali intact, the most notable of which are Ateeq Hussain Khan and the Warsi Brothers. The tradition is kept alive at various Dargahs in the city, including Dargah Yousufain, Dargah-e-Hazrat Shah Khamosh and Dargah Pahadi Shareef.[57][58][59]\n Film-making in Hyderabad was started in early 1917 by Lotus film Co during the Nizams era.[60] The city is home to the Telugu film industry, popularly known as Tollywood,[61] the second largest in India after Bollywood.[62] Since 2005, parallel to Tollywood and Bollywood the city base Hyderabad lingo movies initiated by \"Hyderabad Deccan Film Club\" deccanwood, had gained popularity in the region.[63] Annually the city host, \"International Children Film Festival\",[64] and since 2007, the city has hosted the Hyderabad International Film Festival (HIFF),[65] The Prasad Multiplex houses the world's largest IMAX-3D,[66] In the year 2005, the Guinness World Records declared, The Ramoji Film City located in Hyderabad since 1996, as the world's largest film studio.[67]\n The Khara dupatta or Khada Dupatta (uncut veil) is an outfit composed of a kurta (tunic), chooridaar (ruched pair of pants), and 6-yard dupatta (veil) and is traditionally worn by Hyderabadi brides.[68] Sometimes the kurta is sleeveless and worn over a koti resembling a choli. The bride also wears a matching ghoonghat (veil) over her head. The accompanying jewelry is:[69]\n The Sherwani is the traditional men's garb of Hyderabad. It is a coat-like tunic with a tight-fitting collar (hook & eyelet fastening), close-fitting in the upper torso and flaring somewhat in its lower half. It usually has six or seven buttons, often removable ones made from gold sovereigns for special occasions. The material is usually silk or wool. A groom may use gold brocade for his wedding sherwani, but otherwise good taste dictates understated colors, albeit with rich and textured fabrics. The sherwani is usually worn over a silk or cotton kurta (long shirt) and pyjamas (baggy pants with a drawstring at the waist).\n The Sherwani is closely associated with Hyderabad,[70] although it has spread since to the rest of India and to Pakistan. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru adapted its design and turned it into his trademark Nehru Jacket, further popularizing the garment.\n The traditional Attar, though considered a dying art form, are available in the bazaars near Charminar and the Moazzam Jahi Market. Many of the older generations still prefer attar over modern perfumes.[71][72][73][74]\n The city is home to two types of cuisines, the Telugu cuisine and the Hyderabadi cuisine. The former is the native cuisine of the Telugu people and is influenced by South Indian cuisines while the latter is native to the Hyderabadi Muslims and is more influenced by Mughlai cuisines.\n Hyderabadi cuisine is the traditional cuisine of the Hyderabadi Muslims, originating during the Qutb Shahi and Asaf Jahi periods. It consists of various wheat and rice dishes, often cooked with meat, or paired with meat curries. It is heavily influenced by Mughlai, Persian and Arab, as well as the local Telugu and Marathwada cuisines.[75]\n Some of the most famous dishes include Hyderabadi Biryani, a celebration of basmati rice, mutton, onions, yoghurt and various spices. It's beef variant called Kalyani Biryani is also popular in the city.[76] Hyderabadi Haleem, a stew of wheat, lentils and mutton, is also another specialty of the city, originating from the Arab dish Harees. It is usually prepared during the month of Ramadan. Both of these carry Geographical Indication (GI) tags.[77] Others include Hyderabadi Marag, Pathar-ka-Gosht, Maghz Masala, Khatti Dal, Gil-e-Firdaus, Lukhmi and Hyderabadi Khichdi. Irani Chai is enjoyed all over the city, often with Osmania Biscuits.[78]\n Desserts include Qubani-ka-Meetha, an apricot pudding, Shahi Tukra (also known as Double-ka-Meetha), a bread based dish and Gil-e-Firdaus, the local variant of Kheer.[79][80]\n Telugu cuisine is the part of South Indian cuisine characterized by their highly spicy food. The Telangana state lies on the Deccan plateau and its topography dictates more millet and roti (leavened bread) based dishes. Jowar and Bajra features more prominently in their cuisine. Due to its proximity with Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and northwest Karnataka, it shares some similarities of the Deccan plateau cuisine. The region has the spiciest food amongst all other Telugu and Indian cuisines. Telangana has some unique dishes in its cuisine, such as jonna rotte (sorghum), sajja rotte (penisetum), or Uppudi Pindi (broken rice). In Telangana a gravy or curry is called Koora and Pulusu (Sour) in based on Tamarind. A deep fry reduction of the same is called Vepudu. Kodi pulusu and Mamsam (meat) vepudu are popular dishes in meat. Vankaya Brinjal Pulusu or Vepudu, Aritikaya Banana pulusu or Vepudu are one of the many varieties of vegetable dishes.[81] Telangana palakoora is a spinach dish cooked with lentils eaten with steamed rice and rotis. Peanuts are added as special attraction and in Karimnagar District, cashew nuts are added.\n Sakinalu also called as Chakinalu, is one of the most popular savory in Telangana, is often cooked during Makara Sankranti festival season. This a deep-fried snack made of rice flour, sesame seeds and flavoured with ajwain (carom seeds or vaamu in Telugu). These savories are harder and spicier than the Andhra varieties. Garijelu is a dumpling dish similar to the Maharashtrian karanji, which in Telangana is cooked with sweet stuffing or a savory stuffing with mutton or chicken kheema.[82]\n A distinct Indo-Islamic architecture style with local contribution is reflected in the historical buildings of Hyderabad, making it the first and \"Best Heritage City of India\" as of March 2012.[83] The city houses many famous historical sites constructed during Qutb Shahi and Asaf Jahi period, including various mosques and palaces.[84]\n Hindu Temple Architecture is also seen in the temples of Hyderabad, including the Birla Mandir, Jagannath Temple and Karmanghat Hanuman Temple.[85][86] Modern architectural styles are seen in most buildings constructed after independence.\n Qutb Shahi architecture of the 16th and early 17th centuries followed classical Persian architecture featuring domes and colossal arches.[87] The oldest surviving Qutb Shahi structure in Hyderabad is the ruins of Golconda fort built in the 16th century.\n The most important monuments from this time are the Charminar and Mecca Masjid, both built by Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah, the founder of Hyderabad. Most of the historical bazaars that still exist were constructed on the street north of Charminar towards the fort. The Charminar has become an icon of the city, located in the centre of old Hyderabad. It is a square structure with sides 20 m (66 ft) long and four grand arches each facing a road. At each corner stands a 56 m (184 ft)-high minaret. The Charminar, Golconda Fort and the Qutb Shahi tombs are considered to be monuments of national importance in India. In 2010, the Indian government proposed that the sites be listed for UNESCO World Heritage status.[88][89][90]\n The style is also seen in the Qutb Shahi Tombs, Taramati Baradari, Khairtabad Mosque and Toli Masjid.[91][92][93]\n In the 17th century, Asaf Jahi architecture emerged with palatial style outweighed secular construction. The earliest examples include the Purani Haveli, which served as the seat of the Nizam until the Chowmahalla Palace was constructed. The Chowmahalla Palace, located a stone's throw away from Charminar was constructed over a period of 100 years. It was recently restored and opened to the public.[94][95]\n Another testament to the wealth of Hyderabadi aristocracy is the Falaknuma Palace, built by Sir Vicar-ul-Umra and presented to Mir Mahbub Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VI. It was inspired by Andrea Palladio's villas. The Nizams applied European styles in some of the palaces such as Falaknuma and King Kothi Palaces.[16][96]\n Mir Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII is called as the maker of modern Hyderabad. The buildings constructed during his reign are impressive and represent a rich style of Indo-Saracenic architecture, such as the Osmania University, Moazzam Jahi Market, Hyderabad High Court, Osmania General Hospital, City College and Kachiguda Railway Station. These buildings are quite distinct from their earlier Qutb Shahi counterparts. Most of these were designed by British-Indian architect Vincent Esch.[97]\n The Spanish Mosque, Asman Garh Palace, Errum Manzil, Khursheed Jah Devdi, Mahbub Mansion, Saidani Ma Tomb, Aza Khana-e-Zohra, Hill Fort Palace, Nizamia Hospital, Bashir Bagh Palace (demolished) and Paigah Palace also contribute to the architecture of this period.\n Bazaars of Hyderabad form an integral part of the charm and add to the rich culture of the city. They are described in the poem \"In the Bazaars of Hyderabad\" by Sarojini Naidu. The Old City boasts of a large number of traditional Bazaars.\n The Laad Bazaar adjacent to the historic Charminar is famous for its artificial bangles, pearls, jewelry, semi-precious stones, as well as Bidriware.[98] Chatta Bazaar is famous for its Urdu Calligraphy wedding invitation cards, which are indispensable for every Hyderabadi Muslim wedding.[99][100] Other bazaars include Begum Bazaar, Sultan Bazaar and the Moazzam Jahi Market.\n Cricket is the most popular game in the city,[101] and association football and racquet sports are also popular. At the professional level, the city has hosted national and international sports events such as the 2002 National Games of India, the 2003 Afro-Asian Games, the 2004 AP Tourism Hyderabad Open women's tennis tournament, the 2007 Military World Games, the 2009 World Badminton Championships and the 2009 IBSF World Snooker Championship.\n Prominent sportspeople from Hyderabad include V. V. S. Laxman, Mohammed Azharuddin, Sania Mirza, Mohammed Siraj, Syed Abdul Rahim and P. V. Sindhu.\n Preservation of Hyderabadi Culture is a serious issue. After the Integration of Hyderabad into the Indian Union, a large number of eminent personalities and intellectuals from the erstwhile Hyderabad State migrated to Pakistan.[102] Today, many heritage structures, including the Moazzam Jahi Market,[103] Osmania General Hospital,[104] Mahbub Mansion,[105] King Kothi Palace[105] and the Paigah Tombs[106] lie in a state of neglect.[107][108]\n Urdu Calligraphy, or khushkhat, is also a dying art form.[100][109][110]\n Nawab Mehboob Alam Khan states that many of the old recipes that form Hyderabadi cuisine are being lost.[111]\n",

    "text": "\n The Charminar (lit. 'four minarets') is a monument located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Constructed in 1591, the landmark is a symbol of Hyderabad and officially incorporated in the emblem of Telangana.[3] The Charminar's long history includes the existence of a mosque on its top floor for more than 434 years. While both historically and religiously significant, it is also known for its popular and busy local markets surrounding the structure, and has become one of the most frequented tourist attractions in Hyderabad. Charminar is also a site of numerous festival celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid al-Fitr,[4] as it is adjacent to the city's main mosque, the Makkah Masjid.\n The Charminar is situated on the east bank of Musi River.[5] To the west lies the Laad Bazaar, and to the southwest the richly ornamented Makkah Masjid.[6] It is listed as an archaeological and architectural treasure on the official list of monuments prepared by the Archaeological Survey of India.[7] The English name is a translation and combination of the Urdu words chār and minar, translating to \"Four Pillars\"; the towers are ornate minarets attached and supported by four grand arches.[6]\n The fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, built the Charminar in 1591 after shifting his capital from Golconda to the newly formed city of Hyderabad.\n The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the current caretaker of the monument, mentions in its records, \"There are various theories regarding the purpose for which Charminar was constructed. However, it is widely accepted that Charminar was built at the centre of the city, to commemorate the eradication of plague\", a deadly disease which was widespread at that time.[8][9] According to Jean de Thévenot, a French traveller of the 17th century whose narration was complemented with the available Persian texts, the Charminar was constructed in the year 1591 CE, to commemorate the beginning of the second Islamic millennium year (1000 AH). The event was celebrated far and wide in the Islamic world, thus Qutb Shah founded the city of Hyderabad to celebrate the event and commemorate it with the construction of this building.[10][11]: 17–19 \n The construction began in 1589 and was completed in two years at a cost of  Rs. 9 lakhs, which was around 2 lakh huns/gold coins in those times. Upon completion, it was the tallest structure in Hyderabad. It is said to weigh around 14000 tonnes with a minimum of 30 feet deep foundation. In 1670, a minaret had fallen after being struck by lightning. It was then repaired at a cost of around Rs. 58000. In 1820, some part of it was renovated by Sikandar Jah at a cost of Rs. 2 lakh.\n The Charminar was constructed at the intersection of the historical trade route that connects the city to international markets through the port city of Machilipatnam.[12]: 195  The Old City of Hyderabad was designed with Charminar as its centrepiece.[13] The city was spread around the Charminar in four different quadrants and chambers, segregated according to the established settlements. Towards the north of Charminar is the Char Kaman, or four gateways, constructed in the cardinal direction.[10][12][14][15]: 170  Additional eminent architects from Persia were also invited to develop the city plan. The structure itself was intended to serve as a mosque and madrasa. It is of Indo-Islamic architecture style, incorporating Persian architectural elements. A sample of Charminar is said to have been created at Dabirpura/Nagaboli graveyard before the actual construction.\n \nQutb Shah was also among the early poets of Dakhani Urdu. While laying the foundation of Charminar, he performed the prayers in Dakhini couplets, which are recorded as follows:[16]: 4 [17]\n Dakhini Urdu\nمیرا شہر لوگوں سے مامور کر\nراكهيو جوتو دريا میں مچھلی جيسے\n Charminar was later captured and became an icon of Mughal Empire, the Asaf Jah I was the custodian of the famous structure.\n 80,000 Sepoy units loyal to the Mughal Empire lived within the \"garrison of the Charminar\" and often viewed it as a sister of the Taj Mahal[citation needed].\n \n The Charminar masjid is a square structure with each side being 20 metres (66 ft) long. Each of the four sides has one of four grand arches, each facing a fundamental point that opens directly onto the street in front of it. At each corner stands an exquisitely shaped 56 metres (184 ft) high minaret, with a double balcony. Each minaret is crowned by a bulbous dome with dainty, petal-like designs at the base. Unlike the minarets of Taj Mahal, Charminar's four fluted minarets are built into the main structure. There are 149 winding steps to reach the upper floor. The structure is also known for its profusion of stucco decorations and the arrangement of balustrades and balconies.[18]\n The structure is made of granite, limestone, mortar, and pulverised marble, weighing approximately 14,000 tones apiece.[19] Initially the monument was so proportionately planned that when the fort first opened, one could see all four corners of the bustling city of Hyderabad through each of its four grand arches, as each arch faced one of the most active royal ancestral streets.\n A mosque is located at the western end of the open roof. The remaining section of the roof served as a royal court during the Qutb Shahi times. The actual mosque occupies the top floor of the four-storey structure. A vault which appears from inside like a dome supports two galleries within the Charminar, one over another. Above those is a terrace that serves as a roof that is bordered with a stone balcony. The main gallery has 45 covered prayer spaces with a large open space in front to accommodate more people for Friday prayers.\n The clock on the four cardinal directions was added in 1889. There is a vazu (water cistern) in the middle with a small fountain for ablution before offering prayer in the Charminar mosque.[20]\n The area surrounding Charminar is also known by the same name. It is within the ambit of the Charminar constituency.\n The monument overlooks another grand mosque called the Makkah Masjid. Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the 5th ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, commissioned bricks to be made from the soil brought from Mecca, the holiest site of Islam, and used them in the construction of the central arch of the mosque, hence its name.\n A market named Laad Bazaar is around Charminar. It is known for its jewelry, especially bangles. The nearby Pathargatti boulevard is also an important business street known for its pearls. In its heyday, the Charminar market had some 14,000 shops. The Bazaars surrounding Charminar were described in the poem \"In the Bazaars of Hyderabad\" by Sarojini Naidu.\n Arches in four directions of Charminar are known as Char Kaman. These were built along with the Charminar in the 16th century. These are the Kali Kaman, Machli Kaman, Seher-e-Batil ki Kaman and Charminar Kaman. At the centre of these arches is a fountain called the Gulzar Houz. The Char Kaman are in dire need of restoration, and protection from encroachments.[21][22]\n In 2007, Hyderabadi Muslims living in Pakistan constructed a small-scaled quasi replica of the Charminar at the main crossing of the Bahadurabad neighbourhood in Karachi.[23]\n Lindt chocolatier Adelbert Boucher created a scaled model of the Charminar out of 50 kilograms of chocolate. The model, which required three days' labour, was on display at The Westin, Hyderabad, India on 25 and 26 September 2010.[24]\n \nThe Charminar Express is an express train named after the Charminar, which runs between Hyderabad and Chennai. The Charminar also appears on coins and banknotes of the defunct Hyderabadi Rupee, the currency of the erstwhile Hyderabad State.\n As an icon of the city of Hyderabad as well as the Telangana State, the structure also appears on the Emblem of Telangana, along with the Kakatiya Kala Thoranam.[25][26]\n The Charminar Pedestrianisation Project is an initiative aimed at transforming the area around the iconic Charminar monument in Hyderabad, India into a pedestrian-friendly zone. The project was proposed by the government of Telangana in 2016 and is part of a larger effort to improve the city's urban infrastructure. The Charminar is a historic monument that attracts millions of visitors each year, but the surrounding area is congested with traffic and is not conducive to walking. The Pedestrianisation Project seeks to address this issue by creating a car-free zone around the monument and improving the overall pedestrian experience.\n The project involves the construction of wider sidewalks, pedestrian crossings, and improved lighting, as well as the installation of street furniture and landscaping to create a more attractive and welcoming environment for visitors. The plan also includes the development of a dedicated parking area for visitors to the Charminar, which will be located outside the pedestrian zone.\n The project has been met with some controversy, as it involves the relocation of several street vendors and businesses that currently operate in the area. However, proponents of the project argue that the benefits of creating a more pedestrian-friendly environment around the Charminar will outweigh any short-term disruptions.\n Overall, the Charminar Pedestrianisation Project represents an important effort to improve the urban infrastructure of Hyderabad and create a more attractive and accessible environment for visitors to one of the city's most iconic landmarks.[27] Later during January 2017, the new Government of Telangana introduced a 14-member French Delegation to take over the project to assess the feasibility in developing the monument as an eco-friendly tourism and heritage destination.[28][29] The team has inspected surrounding areas such as the Gulzar house, Makkah Masjid, Lad Bazar, and Sardar Mahal.[30][31][28][29]\n Charminar, along with the Qutb Shahi Monuments of Hyderabad: the Golconda Fort, and the Qutb Shahi Tombs, were included in the \"tentative list\" of UNESCO World Heritage Site. The monument was submitted by the Permanent Delegation of India to UNESCO on September 10, 2010.[32][33]\n A temple by the name of Bhagyalakshmi Temple sprouted up at the base of Charminar in the 1960s. The Archaeological Survey of India—which manages the Charminar—has declared the temple structure as an unauthorised construction.[34] The Hyderabad High Court has stopped any further expansion of the temple.[35] While the origin of the temple is currently disputed, the current structure that houses the idol was erected in the 1960s. In 2012, The Hindu newspaper published an old photograph showing that the temple structure never existed.[36][37] The Hindu also released a note asserting the authenticity of the photographs, and clearly stated that there was no temple structure in photos taken in 1957 and 1962. Additionally, it showed photos that provide evidence that the temple is a recent addition: a temple structure can be seen in photos taken in 1990 and 1994. Also, a temple is seen in a photograph taken in 1986, which is kept in the Aga Khan Visual Archive, MIT Libraries' collections, United States, but not in the earlier ones.[36]\n",

    "type": "wikipedia",
    "text": "\n Golconda is a fortified citadel and ruined city located on the western outskirts of Hyderabad, Telangana, India.[1][2] The fort was originally built by Kakatiya ruler Pratāparudra in the 11th century out of mud walls.[3] It was ceded to the Bahmani Kings from Musunuri Nayakas during the reign of the Bahmani Sultan Mohammed Shah I, during the first Bahmani-Vijayanagar War. Following the death of Sultan Mahmood Shah, the Sultanate disintegrated and Sultan Quli, who had been appointed as the Governor of Hyderabad by the Bahmani Kings, fortified the city and made it the capital of the Golconda Sultanate. Because of the vicinity of diamond mines, especially Kollur Mine, Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large diamonds known as Golconda Diamonds. Golconda fort is currently abandoned and in ruins. The complex was put by UNESCO on its \"tentative list\" to become a World Heritage Site in 2014, with other forts in the region, under the name Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate (despite there being a number of different sultanates).[1]\n The origins of the Golconda fort can be traced back to the 11th century. It was originally a small mud fort built by Pratāparudra of the Kakatiya Empire.[3] The name Golconda is thought to originate from the Telugu గొల్లకొండ Gollakoṇḍa for \"Shepherd's hill\".[4][5] It is also thought that Kakatiya ruler Ganapatideva 1199–1262 built a stone hilltop outpost — later known as Golconda fort — to defend their western region.[6] The fort was later developed into a fortified citadel in 1518 by Sultan Quli of the Qutb Shahi Empire and the city was declared the capital of the Golconda Sultanate.[5]\n The Bahmani kings took possession of the fort after it was made over to them by means of a sanad by the Rajah of Warangal.[3] Under the Bahmani Sultanate, Golconda slowly rose to prominence. Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk (r. 1487–1543), sent by the Bahmanids as a governor at Golconda, established the city as the seat of his governance around 1501. Bahmani rule gradually weakened during this period, and Sultan Quli (Quli Qutub Shah period) formally became independent in 1518, establishing the Qutb Shahi dynasty based in Golconda.[7][8][9] Over a period of 62 years, the mud fort was expanded by the first three Qutb Shahi sultans into the present structure: a massive fortification of granite extending around 5 km (3.1 mi) in circumference. It remained the capital of the Qutb Shahi dynasty until 1590 when the capital was shifted to Hyderabad. The Qutb Shahis expanded the fort, whose 7 km (4.3 mi) outer wall enclosed the city.\n During the early seventeenth century a strong cotton-weaving industry existed in Golconda. Large quantities of cotton were produced for domestic and exports consumption. High quality plain or patterned cloth made of muslin and calico was produced. Plain cloth was available as white or brown colour, in bleached or dyed variety. Exports of this cloth was to Persia and European countries. Patterned cloth was made of prints which were made indigenously with indigo for blue, chay-root for red coloured prints and vegetable yellow. Patterned cloth exports were mainly to Java, Sumatra and other eastern countries.[10]\nThe fort finally fell into ruin in 1687 after an eight-month-long siege led to its fall at the hands of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, who ended the Qutb Shahi reign and took the last Golconda king, Abul Hassan Tana Shah, captive.[11][5]\n The Golconda fort used to have a vault where the famous Koh-i-Noor and Hope diamonds were once stored along with other diamonds.[12]\n Golconda is renowned for the diamonds found on the south-east at Kollur Mine near Kollur, Guntur district, Paritala and Atkur in Krishna district and cut in the city during the Kakatiya reign. At that time, India had the only known diamond mines in the world. Golconda was the market city of the diamond trade, and gems sold there came from a number of mines. The fortress-city within the walls was famous for diamond trade.[citation needed]\n Its name has taken a generic meaning and has come to be associated with great wealth. Some gemologists use this classification to denote the extremely rare Type IIa diamond, a crystal that essentially lacks nitrogen impurities and is therefore colorless; Many Type IIa diamonds, as identified by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA), have come from the mines in and around the Golconda region.\n Many famed diamonds are believed to have been excavated from the mines of Golconda, such as:\n By the 1880s, \"Golconda\" was being used generically by English speakers to refer to any particularly rich mine, and later to any source of great wealth.\n During the Renaissance and the early modern eras, the name \"Golconda\" acquired a legendary aura and became synonymous for vast wealth. The mines brought riches to the Qutb Shahis of Hyderabad State, who ruled Golconda up to 1687, then to the Nizam of Hyderabad, who ruled after the independence from the Mughal Empire in 1724 until 1948, when the Indian integration of Hyderabad occurred. The siege of Golconda occurred in January 1687, when Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb led his forces to besiege the Qutb Shahi dynasty at Golconda fort (also known as the Diamond Capitol of its time) and was home to the Kollur Mine. The ruler of Golconda was the well entrenched Abul Hasan Qutb Shah.[13]\n Golconda fort is listed as an archaeological treasure on the official \"List of Monuments\" prepared by the Archaeological Survey of India under The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act.[14] Golconda consists of four distinct forts with a 10 km (6.2 mi) long outer wall with 87 semicircular bastions (some still mounted with cannons), eight gateways, and four drawbridges, with a number of royal apartments and halls, temples, mosques, magazines, stables, etc. inside. The lowest of these is the outermost enclosure entered by the \"Fateh Darwaza\" (Victory gate, so called after Aurangzeb’s triumphant army marched in through this gate) studded with giant iron spikes (to prevent elephants from battering them down) near the south-eastern corner. An acoustic effect can be experienced at Fateh Darwazaan, a hand clap at a certain point below the dome at the entrance reverberates and can be heard clearly at the \"Bala Hisar\" pavilion, the highest point almost a kilometer away. This worked as a warning in case of an attack.\n The \"Bala Hisar\" gate is the main entrance to the fort located on the eastern side. It has a pointed arch bordered by rows of scroll work. The spandrels have yalis and decorated roundels. The area above the door has peacocks with ornate tails flanking an ornamental arched niche. The granite block lintel below has sculpted yalis flanking a disc. The design of peacocks and lions is typical of Hindu architecture and underlies this fort's Hindu origins.\n The Jagadamba temple, located next to the mosque of Ibrahim and the king's palace, is visited by hundreds of thousands of Hindu devotees during Bonalu festival every year.[15][16] Jagadamba temple is about 900 to 1,000 years old, dating back to early Kakatiya period.[17] A Mahankali temple is located in the vicinity, within Golconda fort.[18]\n The fort also contains the tombs of the Qutub Shahi kings. These tombs display features of Indo-Islamic architecture and are located about 1 km (0.62 mi) north of the outer wall of Golconda. They are encircled by gardens and numerous carved stones.\n The two individual pavilions on the outer side of Golconda are built on a point which is quite rocky. The \"Kala Mandir\" is also located in the fort. It can be seen from the king's durbar (king's court) which was on top of the Golconda fort.\n The other buildings found inside the fort are: Habshi Kamans (Abyssian arches), Ashlah Khana, Taramati mosque, Ramadas Bandikhana, Camel stable, private chambers (kilwat), Mortuary bath, Nagina bagh, Ramasasa's kotha, Durbar hall, Ambar khana etc.\n Naya Qila is an extension of Golconda fort which was turned into the Hyderabad Golf Club despite resistance from farmers who owned the land and various NGOs within the city. The ramparts of the new fort start after the residential area with many towers and the Hatiyan ka Jhad (\"Elephant-sized tree\")—an ancient baobab tree with an enormous girth. It also includes a war mosque. These sites are under restrictive access to the public because of the Golf Course.\n The tombs of the Qutub Shahi sultans lie about one kilometre north of Golconda's outer wall. These structures are made of beautifully carved stonework, and surrounded by landscaped gardens. They are open to the public and receive many visitors. It is one of the famous sight-seeing places in Hyderabad.\n \n Golconda Fort Ropeway, a 1.5 km long ropeway project between hilltop Golconda Fort and 7 Qutb Shahi tombs was approved in September 2025 under Parvatmala, tenders were invited for feasibility study were invited, following which DPR will be prepared for the construction.[19]\n Golconda Artillery Centre, Hyderabad, was raised on 15 August 1962 as the Second Recruit Training Centre for the Regiment of Artillery.[20][21] Golconda Artillery Centre is located in and around the Golconda fort. The Golconda centre has three training regiments and presently trains 2900 recruits at a time.[22]\n The Golconda fort and other Qutb Shahi dynasty Monuments of Hyderabad (the Charminar, and the Qutb Shahi Tombs) were submitted by the Permanent Delegation of India to UNESCO in 2010 for consideration as World Heritage Sites. They are currently included on India's \"tentative list\".[23][24]\n",

    "text": "\n Hyderabadi biryani (also known as Hyderabadi dum biryani) is a style of biryani originating from Hyderabad, India made with basmati rice and meat (mostly goat meat). Originating in the kitchens of the Nizam of Hyderabad, it combines elements of Hyderabadi and Mughlai cuisines. Hyderabad biryani is a key dish in Hyderabadi cuisine and it is so famous that the dish is considered synonymous with the city of Hyderabad.\n Hyderabad was conquered by the Mughals in the 1630s, and ruled by its Nizams. Mughlai culinary traditions joined with local traditions to create Hyderabadi cuisine.[1] : 92  Local folklore attributes the creation of Hyderabadi biryani to the chef of the first Nizam, Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah I, in the mid-18th century, during a hunting expedition.[2][3] In 1857, when the Mughal Empire declined in Delhi, Hyderabad emerged as the center of South Asian culture,[4][5] resulting in a mix of innovations in Hyderabadi biryani.[6][7]: viii  [8]\n The exact origin of the dish is uncertain. Despite legends attributing it to the Nizam's chef, the biryani is of South Indian origin, derived from pilaf varieties brought to South Asia by Arab traders. Pulao may have been an army dish in medieval India. Armies would prepare a one-pot dish of rice with whichever meat was available. The distinction between \"pulao\" and \"biryani\" is arbitrary.[9][10] Hyderabadi biryani incorporated Deccani or Telangana flavors of, perhaps in the Nizam's kitchen.[11]\n Base ingredients are basmati rice, meat (usually goat, but sometimes also chicken or beef), dahi, fried onion and ghee. Spices include cinnamon, cloves, cardamom (elaichi), bay leaves, nutmeg, papaya paste, caraway (shahi jeera), mace flower (javitri), star anise (biryani flower), lemon, and saffron.[3]\n Hyderabadi biryani is of two types: the kachchi (raw) biryani, and the pakki (cooked) biryani.[12]\n The kachchi biryani is prepared with kachchi gosht (raw meat) marinated with spices overnight and then soaked in curd (dahi) before cooking. The meat is sandwiched between layers of fragrant basmati rice and cooked \"in dum\" after sealing the handi (vessel) with dough. This is a challenging process as it requires meticulous attention to time and temperature to avoid over- or under-cooking the meat.[13][14]\n The vegetable biryani is prepared with mixed vegetables in a similar manner to dum biryani with meat.  It is suitable for vegetarians.\n A biryani is usually served with dahi chutney and mirchi ka salan.[15] Baghaar-e-baingan is a common side dish. The salad includes onion, carrot, cucumber, and lemon wedges.\n",

    "type": "wikipedia",
    "text": "\n Hyderabadi haleem (/ˈhaɪdərəbɑːdiː həˈliːm/) is a type of haleem popular in the Indian city of Hyderabad. Haleem is a stew composed of meat, lentils, and pounded wheat made into a thick paste. It is originally an Arabic dish and was introduced to the Hyderabad State by the Chaush people during the rule of the Nizams (the former rulers of Hyderabad State). Local traditional spices helped a unique Hyderabadi haleem evolve, that became popular among the native Hyderabadis by the 20th century.\n The preparation of haleem has been compared to that of Hyderabadi biryani. Though Hyderabadi haleem is the traditional hors d'oeuvre at weddings, celebrations and other social occasions, it is particularly consumed in the Islamic month of Ramadan during Iftar (the evening meal that breaks the day-long fast) as it is high in calories. In recognition of its cultural significance and popularity, in 2010 it was granted Geographical Indication status (GIS) by the Indian GIS registry office,[2] making it the first non-vegetarian dish in India to receive this status. In October 2022, Hyderabadi haleem won 'Most Popular GI' award in the food category, that was chosen through a voting system that was conducted by the Department for Promotion of Industry & Internal Trade (under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry).[3]\n Haleem originated as an Arabic dish[1][4] with meat and pounded wheat as the chief ingredients. It was introduced to Hyderabad by the Arab diaspora during the rule of the sixth Nizam, Mahbub Ali Khan, and later became an integral part of Hyderabadi cuisine during the rule of the seventh Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan.[5][6] Sultan Saif Nawaz Jung Bahadur, an Arab chief from Mukalla, Hadhramaut, Yemen, who was among the seventh Nizam's court nobility, popularised it in Hyderabad.[1][7] Addition of local flavours to the original recipe resulted in a taste distinct from other types of haleem.[8][9]\n Traditionally, Hyderabadi haleem is cooked on a low flame of firewood for up to 12 hours in a bhatti (a cauldron covered with a brick and mud kiln). One or two people are required to stir it continuously with wooden paddles throughout its preparation. For home-made Hyderabadi haleem, a Ghotni (a wooden hand masher) is used to stir it until it reaches a sticky-smooth consistency, similar to minced meat.[10][11]\n The ingredients include meat (either goat meat, beef or chicken); pounded wheat; ghee—(milk fat rendered from butter, also called clarified butter); milk; lentils; ginger and garlic paste; turmeric; red chili pepper spices such as cumin seeds, caraway seeds (shah zeera), cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, black pepper, saffron, jaggery, natural gum, cubeb (kabab cheeni); and dry fruits such as pistachio, cashew, fig and almond. It is served hot topped with a ghee-based gravy, pieces of lime, chopped coriander, sliced boiled egg and fried onions as garnish.[5][12][13][14]\n Different variants have been introduced catering to regional tastes and requirements. A meethi (sweet) variant of haleem is consumed as breakfast by the Arab diaspora in Barkas neighbourhood of the city.[15] The chicken variant is less popular, even though it is lower priced. A vegetarian version of haleem, in which dry fruits and vegetables are substituted for goat meat, is available at some eateries in Hyderabad.[16]\n Hyderabadi haleem is a high calorie dish which gives instant energy as it contains slow-digesting and fast-burning ingredients.[17][18] It also contains dry fruits rich in anti-oxidants.[12][19] The meat and dry fruits make it a high protein food. A new low-cholesterol variety by using emu meat, rich in minerals, phosphorus and vitamins, was introduced in 2013.[20][21] The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), a local civic body that monitors health and safety regulations in the city, has set up hygiene and quality standards to be followed by the eateries selling it.[22]\n Hyderabadi haleem is regarded as an international delicacy.[23][24] In Hyderabad, the dish is often consumed at celebratory events such as weddings.[17] It is consumed especially during Iftaar, the evening meal following the day-long fast, observed by Muslims during the month of Ramadan.[25][26][27][28]\n Pista House, Hotel Shadab, Paradise, Shah Ghouse Café, Cafe 555, Grill 9, Pariwar's Have More, Cafe Bahar, Chicha's, Peshawar, Sarvi and Grand Hotel are some of the many places to try Haleem in Hyderabad[29]\n[30]\n In Hyderabad and neighbouring areas, the month of Ramadan is synonymous with Hyderabadi haleem.[31][32] During the 2014 Ramadan season, ₹ 5 billion worth of Hyderabadi haleem was sold in the city,[33] and an additional 25,000 people were employed in the preparation and sale of haleem.[34] The connoisseur chefs are paid salaries of up to ₹100,000 (US$1,200) a month plus benefits,[35] As of 2011, during Ramadan there were 6,000 eateries throughout the city that sold haleem (70% of which are temporary until Ramadan ends),[36][37] and 28% of Hyderabadi haleem produced in the city was exported to 50 countries throughout the world.[36]\n Sanjeev Kapoor, an entrepreneur of Indian cuisine, mentions in his book Royal Hyderabadi Cooking that the preparation of haleem in Hyderabad has become an art form, much like the Hyderabadi biryani.[38] In 2010 Hyderabadi haleem was awarded Geographical Indication status by the Indian GI registry office. It became the first meat product of India to receive a GI certification.[18][39] This means that a dish cannot be sold as Hyderabadi haleem unless it meets the necessary standards laid down for it.[37][40]\n",

    "text": "\n The Qutub Shahi tombs are a series of Islamic tombs and mosques built by the various kings of the Qutub Shahi dynasty, located in the Ibrahim Bagh (garden precinct), close to the famous Golconda Fort in Hyderabad, in the Hyderabad district of the state of Telangana, India.\n A stunning and concentrated example of Indo-Islamic and Qutb Shahi architecture,[3]  the galleries of the smaller tombs are of a single storey while the larger ones are two-storied. In the centre of each tomb is a sarcophagus which overlies the actual burial vault in a crypt below. The domes were originally overlaid with blue and green tiles, of which only a few pieces now remain.[4]\n The tomb complex forms part of the Golkonda Fort, Fortifications, a Monument of National Importance, administered by the Archaeological Survey of India.[5][6] In 2014, UNESCO placed the complex on its \"tentative list\" to become a World Heritage Site, with others in the region, under the name Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate[7] (despite there being a number of different sultanates).\n The tomb complex lies north of the outer perimeter wall of Golkonda Fort and its Banjara Darwaza (Gate of the Gypsies), amidst the Ibrahim bagh.\n The tombs form a large cluster and stand on a raised platform. They are domed structures built on a square base surrounded by pointed arches, a distinctive style that blends Persian and Indian forms. The tombs are structures with intricately carved stonework and are surrounded by landscaped gardens.[8] The tombs of Sultan Quli, Jamsheed Quli, and Ibrahim Quli were the tallest structures in Hyderabad at the time of their completion.[9]\n The tombs were once furnished with carpets, chandeliers, and velvet canopies on silver poles. Copies of the Quran were kept on pedestals and readers recited verses from the holy book at regular intervals. Golden spires were fitted over the tombs of the sultans to distinguish their tombs from those of other members of the royal families.\n During the Qutb Shahi period, these tombs were held in great veneration. In 1687, during the Siege of Golconda, the tombs were converted into barracks by the invading Mughal army, and the grounds were turned into a camp. Guns were mounted onto the mausoleums in order to bomb the fortress.[10]\n The tombs fell into disrepair until Sir Salar Jung III ordered their restoration in the early 19th century. A garden was laid out, and a compound wall was built. Once again, the tomb garden of the Qutb Shahi family became a place of serene beauty. All except the last of the Qutb Shahi sultans lie buried here.\n The Telangana State Archaeology and Museums Department, in collaboration with the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, has restored the tombs. The restoration of the step-wells within the complex was funded by the US Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation.[11] The restoration work started in 2013,[12][7] and was unveiled by the U.S. Ambassador to India on 10 March 2020.[13] While restoration work paused due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, as of July 2020[update] work had recommenced at a slower rate.[14]\n The complex is popularly known as seven tombs as it houses the tombs of the seven (out of the eight) sultans of the Qutub Shahi dynasty:[3]\n Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk (1518-1543) was the first sultan. \n His tomb, the style of which sets the example for the tombs of his descendants, is on an elevated terrace measuring 30 metres (98 ft) in each direction. The tomb chamber proper is octagonal, with each side measuring approximately 10 metres (33 ft). The entire structure is crowned by a circular dome. There are three graves in this tomb chamber and twenty-one laid out on the surrounding terrace, all of which lack inscription except for the main tomb. The inscription on Sultan Quli's tomb is in three bands, in the Naskh and Tauq scripts. The inscription refers to Sultan Quli as Bade Malik (Great Master) — the endearing term by which all people of the Deccan used for him. The tomb was built in 1543 CE by the Sultan, during his lifetime, as was the custom.[15]\n Jamsheed Quli Qutb Shah (1543-1550) was the second sultan. \n Near the tomb of Sultan Quli is that of his son, Jamsheed. Built in 1550 CE,[16] this is the only Qutb Shahi tomb which has not been fashioned from shining black basalt. Its appearance, too, is quite unlike the other tombs in the garden — it rises gracefully in two stories, unlike the squat tombs of the other kings. Jamsheed Quli Qutb Shah's is the only tomb of a Qutb Shahi ruler without any inscriptions; of course, Jamsheed's son, Subhan's tomb also does not have any inscriptions. \n Subhan Quli Qutb Shah (1550) was the third sultan and ruled for a short time. Subhan's tomb stands midway between the tombs of his father and grandfather. He was popularly called Chhote Malik (Small Master). Subhan's tomb also does not have any inscriptions.\n Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah Wali (1550-1580) was the fourth sultan. \n His tomb, built in 1580, after his death, is slightly larger than Sultan Quli's tomb.[17] Traces of the enameled tiles, which once adorned this mausoleum, can still be seen on the southern wall. The tomb has two graves in the main chamber and 16 on the terrace; some of them probably are those of his six sons and three daughters. There are inscriptions in the Thuluth script on all faces of the sarcophagus. The three famous calligraphists — Isphalan, Ismail, and Taqiuddin Muhammad Salih — who left a store of Naskh, Thuluth, and Nastaliq inscriptions on the many Qutb Shahi edifices in the city, were contemporaries of Ibrahim Shah.\n Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah (1580-1612) was the fifth sultan. \n His mausoleum is considered the grandest of the Qutb Shahi tombs. Built in 1602 CE, the tomb is on a terrace of 65 square metres (700 sq ft) and 4 metres (13 ft) high. A flight of steps leads to the mausoleum proper, which is 22 square metres (240 sq ft) on the outside and 11 square metres (120 sq ft) on the inside. There are entrances on the southern and eastern sides. The tomb is in a vault below the terrace. Inscriptions in Persian and the Naskh scripts decorate it.\n Sultan Muhammad Qutb Shah  (1612-1626) was the sixth sultan. \n Another grand mausoleum, the facade of this tomb was once decorated with enameled tiles; only traces are now evident. There are six graves and inscriptions in Thuluth and Naskh. The mausoleum was built in 1626. \n Abdullah Qutb Shah (1626-1672) was the seventh sultan. \n His tomb is the last of the royal tombs, as Abul Hasan Qutb Shah (Tana Shah), the last Qutb Shahi Sultan, was a prisoner in the fortress of Daulatabad, near Aurangabad, when he died. While the tombs of those who ruled dominate the area, interspersed are many other monuments, most of them tombs of other members of the royal family.\n Hayat Bakshi Begum (died: 1667) was the only daughter of Muhammed Quli Qutb Shah, the fifth sultan, and the wife of Sultan Muhammed Qutb Shah, the sixth sultan, and the mother of Abdullah Qutb Shah, the seventh sultan. She was affectionately known as \"Ma Saheba\" (Revered Mother). The tomb-garden of the sultans of Golkonda was known as \"Lagar-e-Faiz Athar\" (a place for bountiful entertainment) in the days of the Qutb Shahi rulers, for some item or song or dance or even an occasional play was staged here every evening, free of cost, to entertain the poor.\n The last sultan of the dynasty, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah (also known as Tana Shah), was not buried alongside his ancestor. Instead, he was buried at Khuldabad. The mausoleum which Abul Hasan, the last Qutb Shahi Sultan, began building for himself, actually houses the grave of Mir Ahmed, the son of Sultan Abdullah's son-in-law and the sister of Abbas II Safair, the Shah of Persia. The tomb of Fadma Khanum, one of Sultan Abdullah's daughters, stands near the mausoleum of her husband, Mir Ahmed. Hers is the only Qutb Shahi tomb not surmounted by a dome.\n The tomb of Fatima Sultan, with its bulbous dome, is near the entrance to the tomb-garden. Fatima was the sister of Muhammed Qutb Shah. Her tomb houses several graves, two with inscriptions. Immediately to the south of Muhammed Quli's tomb are three uninscribed tombs. There are the mausoleums of Kulthoom, Muhammed Qutb Shahi's granddaughter born of the son of the sultan's favourite wife Khurshid Bibi, her (Kulthoom's) husband and daughter. Kulthoom's tomb is on the west of this cluster.\n The twin-tombs of the two favourite hakims (physicians) of Sultan Abdullah — Nizamuddin Ahmed Gilani and Abdul Jabbar Gilani — were built in 1651. They are among the few Qutb Shahi tombs that are not of royalty. Another pair are those of Premamati and Taramati, the favourite courtesans of Sultan Abdullah Shah, who were laid to rest beside his tomb. One other tomb which is not that of a Qutb Shahi family member is that of Neknam Khan. Neknam Khan, who served in Abdullah's army, was the commander-in-chief of the Carnatic. His tomb is on a platform outside the mausoleum of Ibrahim Qutb Shah. It was built in 1672, two years after Nekam Khan's death.\n To the west of the tombs lies the dargah of Hussain Shah Wali, the revered Sufi saint. He is most affectionately remembered by people as the builder of Hussain Sagar in 1562. Among other monuments in the garden that are not tombs, the most important are the mortuary bath and the Masjid of Hayat Bakshi Begum.\n The mortuary bath, which stands opposite the tomb of Muhammad Quli, was built by Sultan Quli to facilitate the ritual washing of the bodies of the dead kings and others of the royal family before they were carried to their final resting place. The practice followed was to bring the body out of the fort, through the Banjara Gate, to this bath, before carrying it away for burial with the ritualistic pomp that was required to mark the occasion. A large number of people — relatives, officials, friends, and fond subjects — attended. The bath is one of the finest existing specimens of ancient Persian or Turkish baths.\n The Qutb Shahis built a number of masjids all over Golkonda and Hyderabad, and almost every tomb has a masjid adjacent. The biggest and the grandest such masjid is by the mausoleum of Hayat Bakshi Begum. Popularly known as the great masjid of the Golkonda tombs, it was built in 1666 CE Fifteen cupolas decorate the roof and the prayer-hall is flanked by two lofty minarets. The impression, as a whole, is one of majesty and splendour. The inscriptions in the masjid are in calligraphic art.\n \n Golconda-Qutub Shahi Tomb Ropeway, a 1.5 km long ropeway project between hilltop Golconda Fort and 7 Qutb Shahi tombs was approved in September 2025 under Parvatmala, tenders were invited for feasibility study, following which DPR will be prepared for the construction.[18]\n An engraving of a painting by William Purser entitled  The Tombs of the Kings of Golconda. is the subject of a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1838.[19]\n",

Spread over 2,000 acres (810 ha),[1] it is recognized as the world's largest film studio complex by the Guinness World Records.[2][3] Established in 1996 by Telugu media proprietor Ramoji Rao, it has been described as a \"city within a city\" by The Guardian.[4]\n In addition to serving as a major hub for film production, Ramoji Film City is a popular thematic holiday destination, featuring a mix of natural landscapes, artificial sets, and an amusement park. Around 15 lakh (1.5 million) tourists visit the place every year.[5]\n Ramoji Film City, located in Abdullapurmet on the outskirts of Hyderabad, was conceived by Ramoji Rao, a businessman, media proprietor, and film producer.[1] Drawing inspiration from the grandeur of Hollywood studios, it was envisioned as a state-of-the-art facility for film production and a thematic destination for visitors.[6]\n Following the acquisition of land, Ramoji Rao commissioned art director Nitish Roy to design the complex. The site, which originally featured jungles and rugged terrain, was developed with a focus on preserving its natural environment and ecological features.[7]\n The first film to be entirely shot at Ramoji Film City was Maa Nannaku Pelli (1997).[8] According to legends, this film city is built on the war ground of the Nizams and is haunted by the spirits of the soldiers who died here many years before.\n The film city encompasses a wide range of sets and production facilities designed to cater to various filmmaking requirements. The site includes permanent sets such as forests, gardens, mansions, apartment blocks, hotels, a railway station, and an airport,[9] as well as 47 sound stages for indoor filming. Additional infrastructure include a central kitchen to support film crews.[3][10]\n The film city features various entertainment facilities like Filmi Duniya, Wings (birds park), space tour, the wild west, Mahishmati sets for Bahubali franchise, Chandramukhi sets, Fundusthan, butterfly garden, Kripalu caves, Chinese garden, Bhagavatham set, The godless temple, fake prison, Eureka fun place, Rajasthan palace sets, Mughal garden, Vrindavan garden, England sets, and the sets of airport, railway station etc. It creates a memorable moment to tourists.\n The facility is equipped with six hotels and provides internal transportation via vintage buses and air-conditioned coaches.

    "text": "\n Chowmahalla Palace or Chowmahallat is the palace of the Nizams of Hyderabad State located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India.[1] It was the seat of power of the Asaf Jahi dynasty (1720-1948) and was the official residence of the Nizams during their reign. The palace has been converted into a museum and the ownership still lies with the family.[2][3]\n The palace was constructed at the location of an earlier palace of the Qutb Shahi dynasty and Asaf Jahi dynasty[3] close to the Charminar. Construction of the palace, as it stands today, was started by Nizam Ali Khan Asaf Jah II[4] in 1769. He ordered the building of four palaces from which the nomenclature of Chau Mahalla is derived.[5] The word chār or chahār, and its variation chow, means \"four\" and the word mahal means \"palace\" in Urdu, Hindi and Persian.[6]\n While Salabat Jung initiated its construction in 1750, the palace was completed by the period of Afzal ad-Dawlah, Asaf Jah V between 1857 and 1869.[7][8]\n The palace is unique for its style and elegance. Construction began in the late 18th century and over the decades a synthesis of many architectural styles and influences emerged. The palace consists of two courtyards as well as the grand Khilwat (the Darbar Hall), fountains and gardens.[9] The palace originally covered 45 acres (180,000 m2), but only 12 acres (49,000 m2) remain today.[10]\n This is the oldest part of the palace, consisting of four palaces: Afzal Mahal, Mahtab Mahal, Tahniyat Mahal and Aftab Maha, built symmetrically opposite each other in Neoclassical style. The forecourt between the palaces is adorned with a pond and a garden.[2][3]\n The neoclassical palaces have double-height verandahs or façades lined with European style columns. The columns in the Aftab Mahal and Mehtab Mahal are of Ionic order whereas the Afzal Mahal and Tehniyat Mahal have Corinthian columns.[3]\n This part has Bara Imam, a long corridor of rooms on the east side facing the central fountain and pool that once housed the administrative wing; and Shishe-Alat, meaning mirror image.\n It has Mughal domes and arches and many Persian elements such as the ornate stucco works that adorn the Khilwat Mubarak. These were characteristic of buildings built in Hyderabad at the time.\n Opposite the Bara Imam is a building that is its shishe or mirror image. The rooms were once used as guest rooms for officials accompanying visiting dignitaries.\n This is the heart of Chowmahalla Palace. It is held in high esteem by the people of Hyderabad, as it was the seat of the Asaf Jahi dynasty. The grand pillared Durbar Hall has a pure marble platform on which the Takht-e-Nishan or the royal seat was laid. Here the Nizams held their durbar and other religious and symbolic ceremonies.[11] The 19 spectacular Chandeliers of Belgian crystal were recently reinstalled to recreate the lost splendour of this regal hall.[2]\n The main gateway to the Chowmahalla Palace on the western hand has a clock tower also known as a Khilafat clock. The tower is three storeys high and consists of balconies and jharokha of Mughal style same as the style of half domes.[11] It has been ticking since 1750. An expert family of horologists winds the mechanical clock every week.[12]\n This building housed a rare collection of manuscripts and priceless books. The Nizam often met important officials and dignitaries here. Today it is a venue for temporary exhibitions from the treasures of the Chowmahalla Palace Collection of the bygone era.[citation needed]\n The Sixth Nizam, Mir Mahbub Ali Khan, is believed to have lived here and the building was named after his mother Roshan Begum.\n The former Nizam (Barkat Ali Khan Mukarram Jah) and his family decided to restore the Chowmahalla Palace and open it to the public in January 2005. It took over five years to document and restore the palaces of the first courtyard to its former glory. The palace also has a collection of vintage cars, including the Rolls-Royce, which the Nizam kings used.[2]\n The displays in the museum depict the origin and evolution of Hyderabad, achievements and valuable contribution of the Nizams towards the development of the state, and the  social lifestyle of the royal family.\n The museum is divided into parts arranged around two quadrangle courtyards in North and South.[citation needed]\n Conservation works were initiated in Chowmahalla Palace from 2000, where several conservation architects and experts were involved in more than a decade long journey.[13] The initiative was undertaken by Princess Esra Birgen. Before commencement of the works, the place had fallen into disuse for a prolonged period and had deteriorated over the time. The vision for the restoration project was to rescue the exemplary palatial complex and to establish a contemporary civic use as a museum showcasing the splendour and valour of the erstwhile Nizams.[14]\n The restoration process was divided into three stages, first stage involved thorough mapping, a fabric survey, and the development of conservation plans for the buildings' restoration as well as alternative re-use scenarios that might help assess the practicality of these historic buildings. In the second stage, structures that were in danger of collapsing had to be stabilised, and other urgent repairs like waterproofing and propping had to be made to prevent further damage. The complex's physical restoration as well as the addition of amenities to encourage the reuse of these structures were part of the final phase.[15]\n In order to preserve the integrity of these ancient structures, their conservation was carried out using traditional craftsmen and techniques, and several building components were saved from demolition.  Many architectural features, including granite arches, elaborate lime plaster work, and terracotta balusters, were restored carefully in their original design in addition to structural repairs and stabilisation.[15] Apart from bringing back the past glory of the palace complex and reviving traditional materials and craftsmanship,  the project also created a cultural oasis in the heart of the city.[14]\n The project was awarded the UNESCO Asia Pacific Merit award for cultural heritage conservation on 15 March 2010.[2][14] UNESCO representative Takahiko Makino formally handed over the plaque and certificate to Princess Esra, former wife and GPA holder of Prince Mukarram Jah Bahadur.[16][17]\n",

Due to this, Hussainsagar Lake, a lake that has been around since 1563, has been a topic of debate. It is a hotspot of diversity, with 117 species of plants and 162 species of fauna, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and insects.[29] There is a disagreement between the MoEF&CC and the state government regarding whether Hussain Sagar is a wetland or not,[30] causing the issue to remain unresolved. Denotification allows the environmental regulations to become a grey area, which makes the water body vulnerable to exploitation.[31]\n Hussain Sagar Lake forms an important part of Hyderabad but now has become the main sewage collection zone of the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. As a result of heavy anthropogenic pressures such as unplanned urbanization, the entire ecosystem of Hussain Sagar Lake has changed. The water quality has deteriorated considerably during the last three decades. The lake has become shallow due to siltation and accumulation of plant debris. A 2008 study of the lake's water and sediment has found that it has exceeded its eutrophic condition, reaching hypereutrophic status.[32] Many undesirable changes in the structure of biological communities have resulted, and some important species have either declined or completely disappeared. Realizing the importance of conservation of Hussain Sagar Lake, a project has been formulated. This project shall be implemented by APPCB, Hyderabad, India. In this respect, a project feasibility report has been prepared for approval and financing. In spite of the commission of a sewage treatment plant on the western side, a large amount of untreated sewage and industrial effluents continue to flow into the lake.\n",

The capital and the largest city of Telanaga, Hyderabad is home to stately mosques and noisy bazaars lined parallelly alongside swanky new office buildings and malls, and it is these very contrasts – these glimpses into the city’s rich past with inherent promises of an even better future –that make Hyderabad a city worth visiting. Maybe even more than once. The city of pearls and biryani, Hyderabad is home to one of the most iconic landmarks - the Charminar. Translating to 'four minarets', the grand edifice is built entirely out of limestone and granite, with four minarets on four sides, each of them facing a different street. The Charminar stands in a labyrinth of lanes crammed with shops, markets, stalls and shoppers - one of the best places to shop for the authentic pearls and relish the tasty biryanis, skewer kebabs and haleem (the smorgasbord of food that Hyderabad is known for).The other side of Hyderabad - HiTech City or Cyberabad - is a stark contrast to the Old City. The area teems with grand malls, pulsating clubs, sleek restaurants and hi-rise buildings of the every-growing multinationals. Between the old and new lie the popular city areas of Banjara Hills and Jubilee Hills flanked on the northeast by Secunderabad. Hyderabad and Secunderabad together are still referred to as the \"twin cities\", though they are practically one now.Hyderabad pulsates with a spectacular mix of people and traditions.
